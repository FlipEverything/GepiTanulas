D	[ [ Dutch people | Dutch ] ] [ [ chronicler ] ] 
I	Hes actually German nazi and smokes weed and shit . The Shit smoking caused serious health problems in later life . By this we mean literal shit , like , from a butt . His , assosiate , known as ' Tro ' was known to have an enourmous penis , bigger than any building , including the Burj Dubai . At one point , a smokin ' hot chick walked by , causing ' tro ' to have an erection , the resulting devastation is thought to be responsible for causing widespread flooding over much of western europe .

I	Reddot would require a fresh goat be 
D	but in 1479 we find him as prior of the monastery 
D	[ [ Woudsend ] ] in [ [ Friesland ] ] . It seems that , during the struggles between the [ [ Vetkopers and Schieringers ] ] , discipline had become lax in the monastery . A Leydis attempted to reform the monastery , but apparently encountered so much resistance to 
I	bedside every morning 
D	reforms that he was forced to leave in 1480 
D	From sources we know that A Leydis was back in the monastery in Haarlem in 1495 , filling the function of subprior . A Leydis died in 1504 in Haarlem . 
I	Red is also a known gigolo for Angela Merkel 
D	During the [ [ Hook and Cod wars ] ] 
I	Margaret Thatcher And queen Elizabeth I , that's right , he's a necrophile 
D	A Leydis supported the Hook faction 
I	But Angela , Margaret 
D	His sympathies lay in particular with the family [ [ van Brederode ] ] 
I	Elizabeth are actually shemales . Causing extreme gayness to develop within reddot's mind . The gayness then spread to his lungs , where that and 
I	combination of shit-smoking caused his death at age 29 
D	[ [ Egmond Abbey ] ] 
I	Later resurected by filling his corpse with semen , taken from jars kept around his home , he proceded to rape small animals , every day 
D	= = Historical Work = = Johannes a Leydis is mostly known as a historian 
I	continued to rape them even after they died 
D	wrote the following works : * ' ' Chronicon comitum Hollandiae et episcoporum Ultraiectensium ' ' 
I	in fact , this was his aim 
D	a chronicle of the [ [ Count of Holland | counts of Holland ] ] and the [ [ Bishopric of Utrecht | bishops of Utrecht ] ]

D	The work 
I	taking it from several million frenchmen . Red and Ash like logrotating their buttholes . Tar is fat however , and likes to use actual sex toys as 
D	Johannes 
I	result of the fat . After resorting to lesbanism in her late teens , as no penis could get deep enough , as her vaginal opening 
D	Leydis 
I	too wide and deep . Tar now enjoys putting her arm , up the the elbow - into ashiri's mother's vagina , nightly . Ashiri was 
D	well 
I	to be his butt monkey , taking it 
I	ear canal several times a day . Not much is known about his life , but in all likelyhood he came all over young prostitutes from a family

D	It looks like computing of LOW and HIGH limits and considered selection of convenient number is completely different from switch to classical base change formula , but we can see that classic formula simply presumes all frequencies equal to 1 so it is particular case of more generic case considered here . 
D	our frequency table all frequencies are the distances to the next symbol , or , for the last symbol , is distance to base . In case when all them equal to 1 we have classic particular case . In 
I	how to convert 
D	that 
D	can be converted 
I	The reverse process can be also shown 
D	Back conversion is made 
I	a table . It has two logical steps identification 
D	the way as for classic case with only difference that we consider intervals instead 
D	truncation of fractional part . On 
D	first step we divide 25100 by 6 < sup > 5 < / sup > . The result 3.227 is between 3 and base , so we identify first cumulative frequency as 3 , 
D	as D 
I	subtraction 
D	after identification we subtract 6 < sup > 5 < / sup > * 3 from 25100 and divide result by 3 , which gives us 590 . Next symbol is identified by division 
I	correspondent term 
D	590 by 6 < sup > 4 < / sup > , which gives us 0.455 , that means symbol is A and remainder is the same ( 590 - 6 < sup > 4 < / sup > * 0 ) / 1 = 590 . If we continue in the same way to the end we restore correctly the whole original message . If we look at LOW expression we can see that by subtracting 6 < sup > 5 < / sup > * 3 
D	25002 and dividing it by 3 we actually remove first symbol 
D	Naturally , identification works for any number between LOW and HIGH . 
I	{ | class = " wikitable " ! Remainder ! Identification ! Identified symbol ! Corrected remainder | - align = " left " | 25100 | 25100 / 6 < sup > 5 < / sup > = 3 | D | ( 25100 - 6 < sup > 5 < / sup > * 3 ) / 3 = 590 | - align = " left " | 590 | 590 / 6 < sup > 4 < / sup > = 0 | A | ( 590 - 6 < sup > 4 < / sup > * 0 ) / 1 = 590 | - align = " left " | 590 | 590 / 6 < sup > 3 < / sup > = 2 | B | ( 590 - 6 < sup > 3 < / sup > * 1 ) / 2 = 187 | - align = " left " | 187 | 187 / 6 < sup > 2 < / sup > = 5 | D | ( 187 - 6 < sup > 2 < / sup > * 3 ) / 3 = 26 | - align = " left " | 26 | 26 / 6 < sup > 1 < / sup > = 4 | D | ( 26 - 6 < sup > 1 < / sup > * 3 ) / 3 = 2 | - align = " left " | 2 | 2 / 6 < sup > 0 < / sup > = 2 | B | | } In identification we divide result by correspondent power of 6 . The fractional part of division is discarded . The result is then matched against cumulative intervals and appropriate symbol is selected . When symbol is identified the result is corrected . The process continued for known length of the message or until remained result is positive . As we can see the only difference compared to classical formula is identification of symbol that is not sequential integer but the integer associated with interval . A is always 0 and B is either 1 or 2 . D is any of 3,4,5 . This is in exact accordance with our intervals that are determined by frequencies . When all intervals equal to 1 we are having particular case of classic base change , but the computational part is the same .

I	Successful BFM requires [ [ geometry ] ] as much as it does skill and stamina . Pilots must know their aircraft's corner speed , as well as optimum [ [ angle of bank | angles of bank ] ] ( AOB ) and [ [ angle of attack | angles of attack ] ] ( AOA ) , without consciously thinking about them . At the same time , pilots must remain conscious of the angle between them and their opponent's flight path , called the angle off tail ( AOT ) . A high AOT causes a high rate of closure , but makes achieving a suitable guns solution nearly impossible . Aquiring a low AOT , ( getting on the enemies tail ) , is usually the primary goal before an [ [ overshoot ( aviation ) | overshoot ] ] occurs , which can decrease or even reverse closure rate . However , an uncooperative defender may try to take advantage of the high closure rate by turning to increase AOT , forcing an overshoot . One tactic used to decrease AOT is to use various [ [ barrel roll ] ] s called displacement rolls , in order to shift the aircraft laterally from its projected flight path onto a new flight path . By controlling the roll rate the pilot can control the degree of displacement . An attacker following a more maneuverable opponent may become stuck in lag pursuit , ( outside the defender's turn radius ) , unable to achieve a guns solution . By displacing the turn , the two aircraft's flight paths will eventually cross . The AOT will then decrease until the nose of the attacker's aircraft points momentarily at the defender , ( pure pursuit ) , and then ahead of the defender , ( lead pursuit ) .

D	The financial crisis has been linked to reckless and unsustainable lending practices resulting from the deregulation and securitization of real estate mortgages in the United States . { { Dead link | date = November 2009 } } The US mortgage-backed securities , which had risks that were hard to assess , were marketed around the world . A more broad based credit boom fed a global speculative bubble in real estate and equities , which served to reinforce the risky lending practices . { { Dead link | date = November 2009 } } { { Dead link | date = November 2009 } } The precarious financial situation was made more difficult by a sharp increase in oil and food prices . The emergence of Sub-prime loan losses in 2007 began the crisis and exposed other risky loans and over-inflated asset prices . With loan losses mounting and the fall of [ [ Lehman Brothers ] ] on September 15 , 2008 , a major panic broke out on the inter-bank loan market . As share and housing prices declined many large and well established investment and commercial banks in the United States and Europe suffered huge losses and even faced bankruptcy , resulting in massive public financial assistance .

D	= = Classes = = Biotechnology offers an array of classes over four years . Every year students are required to take Spanish , History , English , Math , and Biology . Also during freshman and sophomore years , students are required to take part in Fitness and Health programs . The freshmen are also enrolled in a Computer Applications class to learn how to use Mac computers and all their programs . Unlike other [ [ MCVSD schools ] ] , Biotechnology requires students know Algebra 1 by the time freshman year starts . If the students never took Algebra 1 in Middle School then they are required to take it over the summer between 8th and 9th grade . Algebra 1 classes are taught at Biotechnology outside of the school year , but the parents are required to take the students to these classes . Chemistry ( which also contains material on Forensics ) is taken by all freshmen in 9th grade and Physics is taken by all sophomores in 10th grade . For 11th and 12th grade , students are required to take either Chemistry or Physics for both years . In 11th and 12th grade , students are required to take IB and the classes associated with it . After graduating Biotechnology High school students will have received credit for three IB SL courses ( IB Mathematics , IB Spanish and IB History ) and 3 IB HL courses ( IB Bio , IB Physics or IB Chemistry ( depending on selection in 11th grade ) , and IB English ) . The SL course only are for the duration of 1 year while the HL course are for 2 years . Two electives were introduced in the 2007-2008 school year : Biobusiness , mostly dealing with the economics and business of creating biotechnology-based pharmaceuticals , as well as the regulations and intellectual property laws associated with the business , and Independent Research , which has students develop and run their own experiments . In the 2008-2009 school year , many more electives were added : Bioengineering , which is an introduction to engineering along with a focus on biological engineering ; Anatomy & Physiology ; Environmental Biotechnology , in which students work on various projects designed to either reduce the environment impact of the school or to protect local wildlife ; Communications Techniques and Technology , designed to educate students on the art of public speaking and using technology such as [ [ Microsoft PowerPoint ] ] to assist them ; and Developmental Biology , Advanced Experimental Design , and Independent research . The Environmental Biotechnology classes of 2008-2009 are working on two projects . One is a [ [ rain garden ] ] , designed to clean the runoff from the parking lot of the school , and the other is a conservation project designed to help protect local birds .

I	Following the onset of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 , the Imperial Japanese Army marched rapidly into the heart of Chinese territory . By June 1938 , the Japanese had control of the entire North China . On June 6 , they captured Kaifeng , the capital of Henan , and threatened to take over Zhengzhou . Zhengzhou was the junction of the arterial Pinghan and Longhai Railways , and it would directly endanger the major cities of Wuhan and Xi'an if the Japanese takeover succeeded . To stop further Japanese advance into western and southern part China and to gain some time for the preparation of the decisive Battle of Wuhan , Chiang Kai-shek and his advisors decided to open up the dike of the Yellow River near Zhengzhou to halt Japanese advance with flood water . [ 1 ] The exact location to destroy the dike was originally planned to be Zhaokou , but due to difficulties it was finalized to be at Huayuankou .

D	= = Job classes = = ' ' ' Warrior ' ' ' Warriors constantly seek strength . They might seem to be daredevils due to their desire for power , but are gifted with sharp minds and a good combat sense . With high Health and Strength , their melee capabilities in both attack and defense make themselves the ideal vanguard in all battles . Warriors may be promoted to Knights or Gladiators at Lvl 20 . ' ' ' Magician ' ' ' Wise beyond their years , Magicians love magic above all else . Considered studious recluses , they were often cloistered in the Magi Academy for much of their lives . This has all begun to change as Elga's dark influence begins to threaten their way of life . No book-bound cowards to be dismissed on a battlefield , Magicians of all disciplines make up for frailer bodies with high ranged-damage output and jovially refer to their new way of life as " putting theory in practice " . Magicians may be promoted to Acolytes or Battlemagi at Lvl 20. ' ' ' Archer ' ' ' Archers are ranged physical-damage combatants proficient at swift hit-and-run tactics . Besides making up for low damage-per-hit with an extremely high attack rate , Archers are also dangerous for their ability to launch opponents into the air , thereby incapacitating them while racking up the damage with lightning-quick shots . Archers may be promoted to Hunters or Rangers at Lvl 20 . ' ' ' Thief ' ' ' Growing up in the harsh backalleys was all the training these elusive denizens needed to become the premier melee-damage dealers of Dragonica . Combining agility and power , these claw-wielders are able to deal huge amounts of burst damage up-close , with the primary objective of taking down enemies before receiving much damage themselves . Thieves may be promoted to Jesters or Assassins at Lvl 20 .

D	| Basque Country 
D	It is thought that the Basque Country and neighbouring regions served as a refuge for palaeolithic humans during the last major glaciation when environments further north were too cold and dry for continuous habitation . When climate warmed into the present [ [ interglacial ] ] , populations would have rapidly spread north along the west European coast . Genetically , in terms of Y-chromosomes and Mt-DNA , inhabitants of [ [ Great Britain | Britain ] ] and [ [ Ireland ] ] are closely related to the Basques , < ref name = " McDonald " > [ http : / / www . scs.uiuc.edu / ~mcdonald / WorldHaplogroupsMaps . pdf McDonald , World Haplogroups Maps ] < / ref > < ref > [ http : / / www . nytimes.com / 2007 / 03 / 06 / science / 06brits . html A United Kingdom ? Maybe ] < / ref > reflecting their common origin in this refugial area . Basques , along with Irish , show the highest frequency of the Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup [ [ Haplogroup R1b ( Y-DNA ) | R1b ] ] in [ [ Western Europe ] ] ; some 90% to 95% of males residing in the Basque Country have this haplogroup . The rest is mainly [ [ Haplogroup I ( Y-DNA ) | I ] ] and a minimal presence of [ [ Haplogroup E3b ( Y-DNA ) | E3b ] ] . The [ [ Y-chromosome ] ] and [ [ MtDNA ] ] relationship between Basques and people of Ireland and [ [ Wales ] ] is of equal ratios as to neighbouring areas of Spain , where similar " ethnically Spanish " people now live in close proximity to the Basques , although this genetic relationship is also very strong among Basques and other Spaniards . In fact , as Stephen Oppenheimer has stated in " The Origins of the British " ( 2006 ) , although Basques have been more isolated than other Iberians , they are a population representative of south western Europe . As to the genetic relationship among Basques , Iberians and Britons , he also states ( pages 375 and 378 ) : < blockquote > By far the majority of male gene types in the British Isles derive from [ [ Iberian Peninsula | Iberia ] ] ( modern [ [ Spain ] ] and [ [ Portugal ] ] ) , ranging from a low of 59% in Fakenham , Norfolk to highs of 96% in Llangefni , north Wales and 93% Castlerea , Ireland . On average only 30% of gene types in England derive from north-west Europe . Even without dating the earlier waves of north-west European immigration , this invalidates the Anglo-Saxon wipeout theory [ ... ] [ ... ] 75-95% of British and Irish ( genetic ) matches derive from Iberia .. . Ireland , coastal Wales , and central and west-coast Scotland are almost entirely made up from Iberian founders , while the rest of the non-English parts of the Britain and Ireland have similarly high rates . [ [ England ] ] has rather lower rates of Iberian types with marked heterogeneity , but no English sample has less than 58% of Iberian samples ... < / blockquote > 
I	In fact , in accordance with other genetic studies , a recent genetic piece of research from 2007 claims : " The Spanish and Basque groups are the furthest away from other continental groups ( with more diversity within the same genetic groups ) which is consistent with the suggestions that the Iberian peninsula holds the most ancient West European genetic ancestry .

I	= = Early days to 1922 = = 
D	In [ [ 1860 ] ] , Malta issued its first stamp , back then this country was still a colony of the [ [ United Kingdom ] ] . 
I	A postal system began in Malta in the early 18th century with letters from the Knights of Malta back to Rome and other parts of Europe . Napoleon set up a rudimentary system using an ink stamp simply marked ( Malte ) , but the actual post office did not begin until 1854 . By then it was a British colony and the British set up an overseas post office in Malta . British stamps were used and they were cancelled with the " A25 " obliterator of which there were seven types ( Stanley Gibbons commonmwealth catalogue 2003 ) . So any British stamp with an A25 cancel was used in Malta or Gozo . 1847 was when the GPO in Valletta was set up and it was in the Auberge de Castile a 16th century building , it would remain there until 1990 , when new purpose built quarters of Maltapost were set up in Qormi , to the west of Valletta . In [ [ 1860 ] ] , Malta issued its first stamp , back then this country was still a colony of the [ [ United Kingdom ] ] This stamp was a halfpenny yellow and was issued in different perforations and shades until 1885 , when Malta's first individual set was released . This stamp was legal for Maltese inland postage only and the standard rate for island mail under one ounce until 1943 , overseas mail had to use British stamps until 1885 . January 1 1885 saw the release of Maltese definitives in the values up to 1 / - . The colours reflected Malta joining the UPU and the halfpenny was the same as the 1860 stamp except it was green . The stamps were generic designs of Victoria like most British colonies , but also used the Maltese cross as a heraldic device . This date too saw all British stamps no longer valid for postage except in British military zones and mail ( Where British stamps were used up to 1979 ) . A 5 shilling value complemented the set in 1886 and this was used until 1911 . There was an additional of 4 values in 1899 which included a 2 / 6 and 10 / - value being issued , both survived into the 1920s and a 1919 reprint of the 10 / - is now Malta's scarcest stamp being worth at least 3000 Euro for a mint example . 1901 saw the addition of farthing stamp for newspapers with a view of Grand Harbour . 1902 saw the overseas empire rate drop to 1 penny and the 2.5 d stamps were overprinted with the words " One Penny " . Each sheet had one error stamp with the words " One Pnney " on them and as it was a sheet of 120 stamps , these values attract a premium . 1903 saw the introduction of new low value definitives to 1 / - featuring Edward VII , again apart from Maltese crosses these stamps had little relevance with Malta . 1904 and 1905 saw watermark changes , the 4.5 and 5d values had colour changes in 1905 and 1911 , and the penny and halfpenny were also changed from two colour to one colour stamps . 1911 saw all the remaining values changed to one one colour and 4d and 1 / - had a colour change . The 5 / - value was introduced that looked like the lower values but was two coloured . 1914 saw the start of the George V stamps , but these were similar to earlier issues and they were not fully issued until 1920 because of the war intervening . The 3d value only arrived in 1920 , so the 3d War Stamp of 1919 was a 1903 Edward overprinted ! 1921 saw a replacement of the 1901 farthing stamp to an overprinted George V 2d stamp . There were independence riots in 1919 and 1920 that led tos elf governemnt in 1921 = = 1922 - 1964 = = 1922 saw the George V definitives overprinted with Self Government , but this ruined the design and it didn't last long .

D	= = = Decline of mainstream popularity = = = A number of factors contributed to grunge's decline in prominence . During the latter half of the 1990s , grunge was supplanted by [ [ post-grunge ] ] , which remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century . Post-grunge bands such as [ [ Candlebox ] ] and [ [ Bush ( band ) | Bush ] ] emerged soon after grunge's breakthrough . These artists lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become , namely " a wildly popular form of inward-looking , serious-minded hard rock .

However , in this episode , he just as clearly ' ' expects ' ' that having sex with Darla will remove his soul .

D	[ [ Public roads ] ] in Romania ( excluding street networks ) are classified in a three-tier system : * national ( main ) roads ( 14,500 km ) * district or county roads ( app . 36,000 km ) * communal roads ( app . 28,000 km ) . The national roads are administered and managed by the [ [ National Company for Motorways and National Roads ] ] ( RNCMNR ) - an entity subordinated to the Ministry of Transport . The county roads are administered by the county council and managed by the county's technical department . The communal roads are administered and managed by the village councils aided by the county council's technical office . Road financing is arranged through a Road Fund , which received 45% of the [ [ fuel excise tax ] ] and a [ [ vignette ( road tax ) #Romania | vignette ] ] . This fuel excise tax income was shared between national ( 65% ) and county roads ( 35% ) . The road fund income covers administrative expenses , routine maintenance , loan service payments , and limited rehabilitation costs of the national roads . It also covers part of the costs of county roads ' rehabilitation and maintenance , even though it is sometimes insufficient for this task . Recently , the [ [ Government of Romania ] ] has issued a policy letter for the road sector . It includes , inter alia , a study to keep Romanian road financing up-to-date . Over the past decade [ [ RNCMNR ] ] has secured grants ( [ [ EU-ISPA ] ] ) and several loans from [ [ international financial institutions ] ] ( IFIs ) ( the [ [ World Bank ] ] , [ [ European Investment Bank | EIB ] ] , [ [ European Bank for Reconstruction and Development | EBRD ] ] ) guaranteed by the state , to upgrade its main road corridors . Also , the Government is actively pursuing new external IFI financing or [ [ public-private partnership ] ] s to further upgrade the main roads and improve RNCMNR institutional capacity . RNCMNR's multi-year Highway Development Program and a multi-year Highway Rehabilitation Program are both primarily funded through loans and grants . The communal road network has recently begun receiving support from EU's [ [ SAPARD ] ] program and the World Bank's [ [ Rural Development Project ] ] . Road transport - inside and between the localities - is privatized and performed by numerous buses and trucks operated either by their owners or bus and trucking companies . The issue of road safety has been moving inexorably up the policy agenda in Romania . As in the rest of the world , [ [ road accidents ] ] are responsible for many deaths and serious injuries each year . In an effort to curb this trend in Central and Eastern Europe , a strategic alliance has recently been formed between the [ [ Dutch programme Partners for Roads ] ] and the [ [ World Bank ] ] to jointly contribute to further the development and incorporation of safe road design and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge in Romania as well as in a number of other countries . 
D	The national flag carrier , [ [ TAROM ] ] , is almost entirely state owned ( 99 . 85% of it belongs to different state authorities ) , and there are no current prospects for its further privatization . The air transport infrastructure ( [ [ airports ] ] ) is managed by a " National Company " for international airports , with the [ [ Ministry of Transports , Constructions and Tourism ] ] as the owner and the administrator . The other airports ( serving only national air traffic ) are organized as " Autonomous Operator " ( ' ' Regie Autonomƒ - ' ' ) , which are local public companies . 
D	In the maritime and inland waterways transport sector , similar principles have been adopted where State owned bodies or entities are in charge of the port infrastructure and award concessions to private bodies for port operations . The ports and navigation infrastructure are administered by the [ [ APM-SA Constanta National Company ] ] , [ [ CAN-SA Constanta National Company ] ] , [ [ APDF-SA Giurgiu National Company ] ] , [ [ APDM-SA Galati National Company ] ] , and [ [ AFDJ-SA Galati Autonomous Regie ] ] .

I	In a similar manner as pursued by the English Parliament in their opposition to Buckingham , albeit from a far less disingenuous stance , the Old English within the Irish Parliament argued that their opposition to Strafford did not negate their loyalty to Charles and that Charles , rather , had been led astray by the malign influence of the Earl .

I	Formerly standing within the grounds of Midhurst Castle , the [ [ parish church ] ] of St. [ [ Mary Magdalene ] ] and [ [ Denis | St. Denys ] ] was mentioned in 1291 and later in 1367 as standing , " in a place called Courtgene " .

D	Nieniewska had to left the band . The band posted on their Myspace page : It's right , Joanna Nieniewska was forced to leave the band a few weeks ago ! The reason is a health-problem which should not be specified more detailed , but makes it impossible for her to complete a whole show on stage without risk . But because of the grown big friendship within the band during the last months the band is not willing her to leave totally and so we came to the point that at least Joanna has to be on the road with us when she can't sing with the band anymore and so in future she'll be on tour with us , helping us backstage and doing other important things to bring her support and energy into the band , although it's another way now ! There are no other reasons besides that , although we already had to read different stories on the internet , which are simply not true . As long as you can . .t read it on the offical VoA-homepage or myspace it . .s absolutely not official and does not come directly from the band or the nearest band-environment ! ! ! " Anyway , the band found a replacement for Nieniewska : The good news besides all that is , that we were able to find an absolute suitable substitute for Joanna within the extremely short time ! Her name is [ [ Maxi Nil ] ] ( ' ' pictured above ' ' ) , she's from greece and she has already worked with Moonspell for instance and brings fresh energy and enthusiasm into the band ! She was very fast in practising the material for the shows on metalcamp and with Tarja Turunen and we are already looking forward happily in doing future shows and tours with her !

Munk is best known for his development of [ [ thin airfoil theory ] ] , a means of modelling the behaviour of [ [ airfoil ] ] s by separating their shape ( the " [ [ mean camber line ] ] " < ref > " Mean camber line " is a conceptual curved line drawn through the mean centre of the airfoil , equally spaced from the upper and lower surfaces < / ref > ) and their varying thickness < ref > Distribution of thickness across the [ [ chord ( aircraft ) | chord ] ] , i.e. from front to back of the airfoil < / ref > . This allows separate , and simpler , techniques to model each behaviour . [ [ Lift ( force ) | Lift ] ] may be assumed to depend on the camber ( and [ [ angle of attack ] ] ) alone , and could be modelled by the numerical techniques of the period . [ [ lift‚Ä " induced drag | Drag ] ] depends on the thickness and requires an understanding of [ [ viscous flow ] ] , which was beyond contemporary capabilities . The thin airflow technique was introduced in 1922 and remained the major theoretical design technique until the development of [ [ laminar flow ] ] airfoils in the 1930s . < ref name = " Vincenti , What engineers know " > { { cite book | title = What engineers know and how they know it | last = Vincenti | first = Walter G. | publisher = John Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8018-4588-2 | ref = Vincenti , What engineers know | pages = 36-39 } } < / ref > = = Sources = =

D	There are two sides to every coin and a retort to every opinion . Always read both halves of every discussion . Here is Answering the Critics succeeding in relevant order . ' ' 'A REPORTER‚Ä ô S RESPONSE TO THE INTERNET CRITIQUE OF JOEL WALLACH , DVM , ND , AND HIS AUDIOCASSETTE , ‚Ä-DEAD DOCTORS DON‚Ä ô T LIE . ‚Ä ô ----- by Dr. Morton Walker ' ' ' On pages 126 to 128 of " Book Corners , " the book review section of the Townsend Letter for Doctors & Patients , ( #163 / 164 , February / March 1997 ) , an article appeared criticizing the flamboyant , holistic medical mover and shaker , Joel Wallach , DVM , ND , of San Diego , California . The outright criticism , as published , came from an anonymous source who commented on Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s audiocassette tape , " Dead Doctors Don‚Ä ô t Lie . " Using this cassette tape as a promotional tool , Dr. Wallach offers the public innovative biologic food supplements in the form of colloidal minerals . The audio tape has been broadly distributed by mail and through the internet to the worldwide web . Unlike other reviews appearing in " BookCorners , " this internet " Scientific Critique " was presented to TlfDP readers by an unsigned source - no identity . Did its commentary come from publisher Jonathan Collin , MD , editor Irene Alleger , editorial assistant Jule Klotter , or another usual book reviewer for the TlfDP ? The reader is left to ponder . Such pondering led to my investigations . I was looking for confirmation of the internet critic‚Ä ô s " debunking " of statements made by Dr. Wallach on his audio tape . Where might I find such confirmation ? The internet critic remains anonymous and the magazine‚Ä ô s reviewer is anonymous , too . I decided to be brazen and inquire of the tape producer himself . Besides , although he deserves a chance to reply , Dr. Wallach had not previously been given equal space by TlfDP . Strictly as a reporter on topics of innovative biologics and occasional medical politics , therefore , I pursued the veterinarian turned naturopath to get his response to the unidentified critiquer who often branded Dead Doctors Don‚Ä ô t Lie as " absurd and insupportable . " I also solicited Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s rebuttal , if any , to implied criticisms from the unknown reviewer . ' ' ' The following comments are taken from tape recorded interviews I conducted in person and during telephone conversations with Dr. Joel D. Wallach . ' ' ' ' ' 'A 1991 Nominee for the Nobel Prize in Medicine ' ' ' ( 1 ) The internet critic is unimpressed that Dr. Wallach was a 1991 Nobel Prize nominee for medicine and says " anyone can nominate anyone . " I know that the critic is wrong about the simplicity of this nominating procedure , because I went through it twice in different years for worthy nominees . To nominate someone for the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine , one must first present personal credentials sufficient to warrant receiving an application from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm . When and if the application arrives , the credentialed nominator must fill in the application with accomplishments of the nominee and submit it to the appropriate office at the Karolinska Institute . Such a Nobel Prize nomination for Dr. Wallach is , in fact , quite true , and I hold a copy of the nominating letter from the 3,000 membership , Atlanta-based Association of Eclectic Physicians ( chartered in 1823 ) , dated September 7 , 1990 . It‚Ä ô s signed by Daniel G. Clark , MD and William H. Moore , Jr. , Esq. With three others , Dr. Wallach was to be considered because of his " elucidating the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis as a selenium deficiency . " ' ' ' Performance of Animal and Human Autopsies ' ' ' ( 2 ) The critic expresses doubt that Dr. Wallach performed 3,000 autopsies on humans . He did perform 17,500 autopsies on 454 species of animals and , because of his experience , he was frequently asked to render professional opinions on human autopsy material . Starting in 1962 Dr. Wallach performed " re-do " human autopsies on " autopsy sets " supplied by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . These " sets " consist of an average of 400 pathology slides of human tissue along with the patients‚Ä ô health histories . It‚Ä ô s standard procedure for pathologists to study this way and , upon completing a " set , " the pathologist is credited with having performed an autopsy . As a graduate student working toward his PhD , Dr. Wallach taught pathology at Iowa State University as well . From 1966 to 1968 , Dr. Wallach was a postdoctoral fellow with he Center for the Biology of Natural Systems , Washington University at St. Louis , Missouri . There he continued to do animal and human autopsies under the supervision of board certified pathologists . ' ' ' People Suffer from Pica ' ' ' ( 3 ) The critic looks askance at Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s description of pica being a form of cribbing . Pica is the indiscriminate eating by humans of non-nutritious substances with current evidence showing it‚Ä ô s a manifestation of particular mineral deficiencies . The variety of animal pica is referred to as cribbing , and includes the eating of harmful substances such as stones and materials forming the animals‚Ä ô stalls or cribs . Dr. Wallach advises me that the snack food industry has managed to convert people with pica from eating ice , dirt and grass to eating sugared foods and salty chips - the munchies . This craving among mostly inactive people comes from their expressing mineral deficiencies . Pica is a symptom of mineral deficiencies , including iron and phosphorous . ' ' ' Medical Doctors Die at Average Age 58 ' ' ' ( 4 ) The critic questions Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s statement on his tape that US medical doctors have shorter life expectancies than the average American , who dies at 75.5 years . He collects MD obituaries , including the announcements of death in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) . From the small evaluation he performed on January 20 1993 , Dr. Wallach concludes that AMA members are seemingly dying at an average age of 57.6 years . Dr. Wallach says , " Even if the internet critic is correct in stating that the average physician lives 70 years , that‚Ä ô s still five and a half years less than the life expectancy of the average American citizen ! " ' ' ' An Anticancer Diet Exists ' ' ' ( 5 ) The critic disagrees with Dr. Wallach that an anticancer diet has been found . But this announcement was headlined in September 1993 from a press release issued by the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . Anticancer dietary supplements , specifically selenium , were pinpointed on December 25 , 1996 by researchers at the University of Arizona , who published their findings in JAMA . ' ' ' The Incidence of Alzheimer‚Ä ô s Disease ' ' ' ( 6 ) In disagreeing with Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s statistic of Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease being as high as 50% among people over age seventy , the internet critic states that the incidence of Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease actually is 3 . 9% . The critic is dead wrong again ! I co-authored a book showing causes and treatments for dementia of the Alzheimer‚Ä ô s type ( DAT ) , Toxic Metal Syndrome : How Metal Poisonings Can Affect Your Brain , with H. Richard Casdorph , MD , PhD , of Long Beach , California , and our statistics differ sharply from he critic‚Ä ô s numbers . In contrast , Dr. Wallach comes close to being correct . In the book , I wrote : " ... Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease affects up to 10% of persons over sixty-five , 25% of those over eighty , and nearly 50% over eighty-five .. . It is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States with an upward trend producing approximately 350,000 newly diagnosed cases of Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease annually . " 1 ' ' ' Pigs Manifest Alzheimer‚Ä ô s Disease ' ' ' ( 7 ) In disputing Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s knowledge and statements as a veterinarian , the critic says that " pigs don‚Ä ô t get Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease . " Dr. Wallach points out the at the critic is using incorrect terminology in referring t the animals‚Ä ô disability . In pigs , chickens , and other animals , Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease is called encephalomalacia , a brain syndrome that matches the human form of such dementia . As with elderly humans , a type of DAT does affect pigs . ' ' ' Butter is Better than Olive Oil ' ' ' ( 8 ) This critic commenting over the internet prefers olive oil to butter as an eating and cooking fat , but Dr. Wallach likes butter better . He took his information from the eating habits of long-lived societies who use butter and yak fat , and those third world cultures often live to be 120 years old or beyond . ' ' ' Copper Deficiency Causes Gray Hair and Wrinkles ' ' ' ( 9 ) The critic comments adversely on Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s belief that copper deficiency is the source of gray hair and facial wrinkles and labels the statement as " absurd and insupportable . " Dr. Wallach has the research showing that the enzyme lyseal oxidase requires copper as a cofactor to change proelastin into elastin . If one is copper deficient , the process of making elastin stops so that wrinkles , sagging tissues , varicose veins and other skin difficulties develop . As to copper‚Ä ô s connection to gray hair , the mineral is required to form melanin which pigments hair . If you lack copper , pigment will be sparse or absent . In animal husbandry , if a sheep farmer wants his black animals to grow white wool , he gives them a copper deficiency . Turkey farmers are able to raise birds with the same colorings as zebras - stripes or bars of black and white or brown and white . As the turkeys‚Ä ô feathers grow and molt , the farmers alternate feedings to produce copper deficiency and then copper sufficiency ... copper deficiency ... copper sufficiency ... copper deficiency ... copper sufficiency , as the feathers go through their growth cycles . A bar-like effect is the result . ' ' ' Cardiomyopathy Comes from a Selenium Deficiency ' ' ' ( 10 ) The anonymous critic totally disagrees with Dr. Wallach who states that cardiomyopathy derives from a selenium deficiency . In 1957 , veterinarians learned that cardiomyopathy and muscular dystrophy in animals were caused by selenium deficiency . Cardiomyopathy in animals is called mulberry heart disease and muscular dystrophy is known as white muscle disease . As a veterinarian , Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s training gives him certain advantages over doctors who treat humans only , for he reads the literature of both groups . During the 1980's , Dr. Wallach conducted extensive study in China on a fatal form of cardiomyopathy in humans known as Keshan disease ( KD ) . In this study , Dr. Wallach analyzed autopsy material from 1700 cases of DD at Harbin Medical University , Shanghai Medical University and Beijing Medical University . The results of this study have been published in two Chinese medical journals . There was no selenium in the crop soils of Keshan China , so 13 out of every 1,000 children died of cardiomyopathy . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) sent in a group of scientists who determined that , indeed , selenium deficiency was causing the problem . One milligram of sodium selenite ( NaSe ) fed to 36,000 school children was compared to 9,000 controls who received no selenium . The result proved the lack of selenium was the cause of cardiomyopathy heart disease . There were no genetic or infectious factors involved . ' ' ' The Death of Dr. Stewart Berger ' ' ' ( 11 ) Then the critic played up the death of Stewart Berger , MD , of New York City as resulting from cardiomyopathy because he was obese and probably abused drugs . Dr. Wallach declares that even persons with bad habits and who supplement their diets with nutrient pills not being absorbed as had Dr. Berger , have a high probability of selenium deficiency . ' ' ' Identifying the Anonymous Critic ' ' ' ( 12 ) At this point during our interviews , in response to my prodding him with certain additional irritating comments coming from his highly critical challenger , Dr. Wallach identified whom he suspects as the anonymous internet critic . Dr. Wallach stated : " I believe this anonymous internet critic actually is the paid consultant for several commercial companies that sell multivitamin and multi-mineral pills . The motivation to criticize is likely to come from this critic‚Ä ô s desire to try and knock me off as a nutritional supplement competitor . I‚Ä ô ve heard the same erroneous commentary from the critic before . " ' ' ' Aneurysms Arise from a Copper Deficiency ' ' ' ( 13 ) When it comes to aneurysm , the internet critic indicates that Dr. Wallach is off base when he blames aneurysm on a deficiency of copper . Although there exist 40 different listings of aneurysm types , only one root cause of them prevails , replies Dr. Wallach . It does not matter how they get classified , lack of copper starts up the entire pathological process evolving into aneurysm . " Remember , copper is required as a cofactor to convert proelastin into elastin or elastic fibers ; the basic root cause of all Aneurysms is a disruption of the elastic fibers of the artery walls , " says the veterinarian / naturopath . " The fundamental definitive research on aneurysm and copper deficiency was performed on turkeys for farmers . " ' ' ' Male Pattern Baldness Comes from a Tin Deficiency ' ' ' ( 14 ) The critic says that Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s remarks concerning tin as a cause of baldness " is entirely incorrect . " Yet , work with animals was published in Kyoto , Japan in 1990 that indicates tin ( Sn ) deficiency stimulates the development of male pattern baldness . Rats fed tin at 17.0 ng / gm show poor growth , reduced feeding efficiency , hearing loss , and bilateral ( male pattern ) hair loss , while rats fed 1.99 ng / gm were physiologically and anatomically normal . Tin , in fact , is a prevention factor for cancer . Also , a November 1991 US federal study shows that the lack of tin in the diet leads to impaired hearing for older men at any given age than in men of earlier generations . ' ' ' Calcium Deficiency Causes Bell‚Ä ô s Palsy ' ' ' ( 15 ) This internet critic totally discounts Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s claim that Bell‚Ä ô s palsy , a condition with neurological symptoms , comes from a calcium deficiency . When someone comes down with osteoporosis , the veterinarian / naturopath explains , bones try to get stronger by generating connective tissue so that they actually become measurably larger . The bones squeeze against the nerves . In Bell‚Ä ô s palsy the seventh cranial nerve gets compressed by the newly grown connective tissue . To reverse Bell‚Ä ô s palsy , therefore , it is necessary to take minerals and other nutrients that reverse osteoporosis , nutrients which may include calcium , magnesium , chondroitin sulfate , etc. The bones will then revert to their normal size and ease pressure on the seventh cranial nerve and Bell‚Ä ô s palsy goes away . Other neurological involvements relating to osteoporosis from calcium deficiency are tinnitus ( which may be associated with vertigo and then it‚Ä ô s called Wallach‚Ä ô s vertigo ) , spinal stenosis , and tic douloreux or trigeminal neuralgia . Corticosteroids do help temporarily because they stop the inflammatory-like process affecting the connective tissues . But to get rid of these problems , calcium and chondroitin sulfate must be given to correct osteoporosis . ' ' ' Vanadium / Chromium Deficiencies Upset Sugar Metabolism ' ' ' ( 16 ) The internet critic puts no stock in Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s focus on vanadium and chromium being two essential minerals involved in sugar metabolism . The critic says that vanadium isn‚Ä ô t even recognized as an essential nutrient for humans . Dr. Wallach replies : " Vanadium and chromium affect sugar and fat metabolism . In 1985 , the Vancouver Medical School declared that vanadium alone could replace insulin for adult onset diabetics . " ' ' ' Arthritis is Osteoporotic Bone Ends ' ' ' ( 17 ) The internet critic flatout says that it‚Ä ô s incorrect to describe arthritis as being osteoporosis of the joint ends of the bones . Dr. Wallach is firm in his admonition about wear and tear arthritis coming from poor nutrition . Such a nutritional lack will be connected to the presence of osteoporosis . He told me , " When the bone melts away , the cartilage wears through and all this relates to calcium and other minerals being deficient . . Arthritics deficient in calcium will also be lacking in other minerals such as sulfur , magnesium , and so forth . " ' ' ' Dr. Wallach Dismisses Good Oral Hygiene ' ' ' ( 18 ) Shocked ! Is the reaction of the internet critic as related to Dr. Wallach discounting good oral hygiene as a prevention of periodontal disease . In turn , the audio tape producer explains " When one gets receding gums , gingivitis , pyorrhea periodontitis , loose teeth , and other gum disease , the dental profession has the malignant belief that infection is causing the problem . That‚Ä ô s dumb ! The baseline trouble is osteoporosis of the jaw and facial bones . That‚Ä ô s because the bones are rather thin and disappear quickly in the presence of osteoporosis . The key to treatment is to give enough calcium and other minerals . Good oral hygiene may assist against the associated secondary infection but not the osteoporosis . " ' ' ' The Eating Habits of Long-Lived People ' ' ' ( 19 ) " One of the most simplistic and nonsensical claims made on this tape , " says the internet critic , " is that people who live to be 100 years old drink 40 cups of tea every day and put rock salt and two pats of butter in each cup . " Dr. Wallach backs up his statement by advising that these long lived folk reside in semi-arid locations high in the mountains . Therefore , they drink numerous two - to four-ounce cups of tea and coffee daily and do use butter and salt in their beverage . His information , he assures me , comes from the National Geographic magazine , published in January 1973 . ' ' ' Surgeons Make Mercedes Payments by Doing Hysterectomies ' ' ' ( 20 ) The internet critic takes a pro-AMA stance when he or she unequivocally states as a defense of surgeons , " hysterectomies are being performed mostly because of ovarian cancer or other diseases . " Dr. Wallach says , " 365,000 hysterectomies are done each year and the group , Physicians for Responsible Medicine declare that only 10% are of value . That group has supplied me with my figures . The same statement was published again by that group in March 1997. " ' ' ' Osteoporosis Brings on Most Low Back Pain ' ' ' ( 21 ) The critic labels " absurd " Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s claim that osteoporosis is responsible for bringing on low back pain most of the time . " Calcium deficiency is behind all types of back pain because osteoporosis causes the actual symptomatology , " this tape producer says in response . ' ' ' Diabetes Cured with Vanadium / Chromium Supplementation ' ' ' ( 22 ) The critic wants to see Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s patient records showing that diabetics get permanent help by the appropriate use of vanadium and chromium supplementation . " You can wean adult onset diabetics off insulin , merely by giving them the amounts of vanadium and chromium that they need , states the doctor . ' ' ' Colloidal Minerals that Are Metallic and Non-Metallic ' ' ' ( 23 ) The anonymous individual who has given us this so called " scientific critique " wants to see Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s documentation for his statement about metallic minerals and their 8 to 12% absorbability . In answer , the Dead Doctors Don‚Ä ô t Lie lecturer says , " Plant-derived colloidal minerals don‚Ä ô t come from soils as do elemental metallic minerals that are fossilized and taken from the ground . After age 35 the ability of a human to absorb metallic minerals drops to 3 to 5% . I took those numbers from the seventh edition of Food , Nutrition and Diet Therapy , written by Krause and Maham , published by the W.B. Saunders Company in 1984 . Gerhardt Schrauzer , Dsc , Professor Emeritis at the University of California at San Diego , shows that plant-derived colloidal minerals are ten times more absorbable than soil-derived elemental minerals . " ' ' ' Vitamin Tablets Appear in Portable Toilets ' ' ' ( 24 ) The internet critic doesn‚Ä ô t believe that the owner of a portable toilet company sees vitamin tablets lying in his porta potties . In answer , Dr. Wallach assures me that the portable toilet company is located in Grand Rapids , Michigan . " Also , the public works department of Salt Lake City , Utah fills two 55 gallon cans with loads of vitamin and mineral pills each year . The pills clog their sewer system‚Ä ô s grid for the sewer processing plant . Call the city‚Ä ô s public works department to confirm my statement , " advises Dr. Wallach . ' ' ' Iron Oxide ( Rust ) in Nutrient Formulations ' ' ' ( 25 ) Being facetious , the internet critic says he‚Ä ô s never found rust listed on the label of any nutrient formulation . Since he didn‚Ä ô t understand the commentator‚Ä ô s criticism , Dr. Wallach agreed that iron oxide found on labels for bottles of multi minerals is rust and otherwise offered no other reply to the implied criticism . ' ' ' The Wallach Calcium Lactate Story ' ' ' ( 26 ) The critic disdains Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s claim that only 10% of calcium is a 1000-mg tablet of calcium lactate containing 250mg of calcium is absorbed . Dr. Wallach does , indeed correct himself and advises that calcium lactate holds just 140 mg of calcium with only 14mg absorbed . The tablet‚Ä ô s balance is 860mg of milk sugar which has little nutritional value . ' ' ' 98 Percent of Colloidal Minerals are Absorbed ' ' ' ( 27 ) The critic is dubious of the audio tape‚Ä ô s statement relating to 98% colloidal mineral absorption because Dr. Wallach sells colloidal minerals from plants . As quoted from his book , Rare Earths : Forbidden Cures : " Mineral colloids are found in the living systems of bacteria , fungi , green plants ( food crops ) , animals and humans and are coated by a water loving ( hydrophilic ) substance such as gelatin , albumin , albuminoids , or collagen . This coating protects the now ‚Ä-organic mineral colloid‚Ä ô and allows it to be a crystalloid for absorption , storage and physiological uses , thus maximizing its bioavailability to 98% . " ' ' ' Proof of the Value of Colloidal Minerals ' ' ' ( 28 ) Proof of colloidal mineral value is demanded by our internet critic , and I‚Ä ô ve just cited a paragraph from an entire book on the subject ( 496 pages ) written by Dr. Wallach as providing that proof . ' ' ' Colloidal Minerals Stored in the Human Body ' ' ' ( 29 ) A real difference of opinion exists between the internet critic and Dr. Wallach as regarding the presence of colloidal minerals in the human body . The critic emphasizes that they‚Ä ô re only present in the ionic state . In contrast , Dr. Wallach says , " The minerals stored with proteins and lipids are in the colloidal form . The free , ionic minerals found in the human body are in the blood and interstitial tissues , and some minerals formed there are floating colloids as part of cells and interstitial tissues . " ' ' ' Long-lived Cultures Drink Glacial Water ' ' ' ( 30 ) The internet critic‚Ä ô s final complaint is that glacial water drunk by long-lived cultures furnishes metallic minerals and not colloidal ones . " That‚Ä ô s not my point , " Dr. Wallach replies . " The populations noted for longevity get only a very small amount of minerals from drinking glacial milk . Rather , those long-lived societies irrigate with glacial milk to create soil by taking muck out of rivers , agricultural debris and animal manure . They merely irrigate with glacial milk which puts metallic minerals into the soil . The plants absorb these elemental minerals to produce plant-derived colloidal minerals and the people eat those plants . " This internet critic who is complaining about me is a paid hack for numbers of multivitamin , multi mineral companies who are getting hurt by the colloidal mineral movement , " affirms Dr. Wallach . " The companies are paying the person to try and do a hatchet job on me . " ' ' ' Aluminum Present in Colloidal Minerals . ' ' ' ( 31 ) Next we drop to criticisms brought to this book review section by someone who has chosen to ally with Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s internet critic and to remain anonymous as well . Using literature coming from the very multi nutrient manufacturing competitors Dr. Wallach alluded to just above in criticism #30 , the Townsend Letter critic questions the presence of aluminum and strontium in colloidal minerals . My interview of Dr. Wallach causes me also to be at odds with him on this point . In our warnings about toxic metals as the source of Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease , my co-authored book , Toxic Metal Syndrome centers its precautionary notes most emphatically on avoiding aluminum . " In my own book , Rare Earths : Common Cures , I list a lot of common foods containing aluminum : asparagus , beans , Brussels sprouts , celery , cucumbers and much more . There is much more colloidal aluminum in two slices of cucumbers than in a whole bottle of colloidal minerals , " Dr. Wallach states . " Aluminum makes up 12% of the Earth‚Ä ô s crust and as our planet‚Ä ô s most common , it is found in all foods and water . Aluminum has nothing to do with Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease . That‚Ä ô s medical ‚Ä-Ka-Ka‚Ä ô ( the stuff left behind in babies‚Ä ô diapers ) . I don‚Ä ô t tell my patients to avoid aluminum deodorants . I want my patients to smell good ! " My impression is that Dr. Wallach is shooting himself in the foot by putting out this opinion which goes against vast numbers of medical references and only gives aid to the aluminum industry of the United States and Canada . ' ' ' Vitamin E Prevents Alzheimer‚Ä ô s Disease in Pigs ' ' ' ( 32 ) Quoting the competitive mineral manufacturer‚Ä ô s literature again , the unknown TlfDP reviewer says pigs don‚Ä ô t get Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease . " With the pig still alive , how would you determine if the pig had Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease ? " wonders the reviewer . As Dr. Wallach explained in #7 above , pigs do come down with dementia of the Alzheimer‚Ä ô s type ( DAT ) . " In pigs , Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease is called encephalomalacia , a brain syndrome that matches the human form of such dementia . As with elderly humans , a type of DAT does affect pigs , " he repeats . " The way one knows the pig has Alzheimer‚Ä ô s disease is to do an autopsy , the only verifiable method for the condition , just as in humans . " ' ' ' Again Questioned , Tin Deficiency Causes Baldness ' ' ' ( 33 ) Our TlfDP critical reviewer again uses the competitive manufacturer‚Ä ô s printed material to question Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s blaming male pattern baldness on tin deficiency . The veterinarian / naturopath once again cites his references ( shown below at footnote number 4 and 5 ) . Added to this is another statement made in a letter dated February 25 , 1997 written to the editor of Self magazine by Dr. Gerhardt N. Schrauzer of San Diego . Informing the magazine , Dr. Schrauzer writes , " As to tin deficiency as a possible cause of baldness , few of Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s critics probably know that his view is backed by animal experiments originally performed by K. Schwarz , et . al. And more recent evidence by K. Yokoi , M. Kimura , and Y. Itokawa of Kyoto University , who found alopecia developing in rats maintained on a low tine diet . ' ' ' Reduction of Hcl and Digestive Enzymes ' ' ' ( 34 ) The Townsend Letter critic sides with the internet critic as regards Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s claim that there is 3 to 5% absorption of metallic minerals . The two critics say that‚Ä ô s " ridiculous . " Dr. Wallach replies , " Hypochlorhydrin is a common problem once people hit 35 years of age and that‚Ä ô s why betaine hydrochloride sells so well . The reason people younger get it is because they‚Ä ô re put on a low-salt diet by ignorant doctors . " ' ' ' Osteoporosis is a Source of Low Back Pain ' ' ' ( 35 ) " We concur with the internet author " who thinks it‚Ä ô s absurd to say that osteoporosis is a source of low back pain , " affirms the TlfDP critical reviewer . So who is the Townsend Letter critic agreeing with ? What are the internet critic‚Ä ô s qualifications ? " asks Dr. Wallach . ' ' ' Vanadium Is Not an Essential Nutrient ' ' ' ( 36 ) This critic representing the TlfDP agrees with the internet critic when he or she says , " ... vanadium has not been recognized as an essential nutrient for humans and this is a true statement . " Dr. Wallach is firm when he says , " The Townsend Letter is wrong : it‚Ä ô s a false statement ! " See below for the references footnoted from Dr. Wallach‚Ä ô s book , Rare Earths : Forbidden Cures , which indicate vanadium deficiency is associated with he following multiple health problems : ( a ) slow growth , ( b ) increased infant mortality , ( c ) elevated triglycerides , ( d ) cardiovascular disease , ( e ) elevated cholesterol , ( f ) hypoglycemia , ( g ) hyperinsulinemia , ( h ) diabetes , ( i ) infertility , and ( j ) obesity . " ' ' ' PMS Derives from Calcium Deficiency ' ' ' ( 37 ) The TlfDP unnamed reviewer thinks it‚Ä ô s absurd to declare calcium deficiency as the cause of premenstrual syndrome . Dr. Wallach responds with a quote from a University of California news release which said seven years ago : " As much as 85% of the emotional and physical symptoms of PMS derives from calcium deficiency . " ' ' ' Giving You the Rest of the Story " ' ' ' ( 38 ) The TlfD&P critical reviewer , an admirer of Paul Harvey , believes that the internet critic has been ‚Ä-giving you the rest of the story . " Dr. Wallach doesn‚Ä ô t accept such sloganeering . " Let‚Ä ô s have the internet author identified so that I can show you how little education he has , " says the lecturing veterinarian turned naturopath . In contrast , Dr. Wallach offers his own qualifications , " I have had 75 peer - reviewed articles published in medical and veterinary journals . I‚Ä ô ve contributed chapters to 8 multi authored textbooks . I‚Ä ô ve written a textbook of my own , The Diseases of Exotic Animals , containing more than 1000 pages and 2,000 illustrations , published by W.B. Saunders in . It describes over 13,500 of the 17,500 autopsies I‚Ä ô ve performed on large and small exotic animals , " he advises . " I have graduate hours of human and animal pathology , and I gone through a three-year post-doctoral fellowship in comparative pathology . " ' ' ' Now you really do have the rest of the story !

I	= = = Crested Venator = = = This middleweight dragon greatly resembles the Horntail in agression and strength . Males range from 90-100 feet in length and typically have a 110-125 foot wingspan . Males are usually black and grey with a white belly when mature and can fly at speeds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour for long periods of time . Females are typically 100-110 feet in length and have a wingspan of 120-130 feet . Females are typically white and grey when mature and can fly at speeds in excess of 120 kilometers per hour . The Crested Venator's weight typically ranges from 20-23 tons when fully grown . Infants and juveniles show extreme agression and agility , though less intelligence than a mature adult . As the name suggests , the Crested Venator has crest of cranial poisonous spines surrounding a " beard " that can be puffed up to give the animal a larger appearence ( much like the Bearded Dragon ) . The Crested Venator also has poisonous dorsal spines and fringed scales along the sides of its belly . Two retractable fangs , which can be used to spit highly acidic venom at distances exceeding 80 feet , reside in the roof of the mouth . The Crested Venator's venom registers at below 0 on the pH scale . It's toxicity matches that of the Inland Taipan . The venom is rather viscous when it settles and quickly blinds and burns its prey . After mere minutes the venom will cause paralysis , cardiac arrest , and death . Large canine teeth and rows of over 200 razor-sharp serated teeth ( which are filled with bacteria and parasites that do not actually harm the Venator ) envelope its oral cavity as well . Sensory pits , much like those on a modern-day rattlesnake , can sense even the slightest of vibrations and heat signatures . Crested Venators have acute hearing and superb eyesight . Crested Venators can reach a top land-speed of 95 kilometers per hour . Their powerful rear legs can propel them great distances , enabling them to leap over walls and on-top of low-lying buildings . Much like a Velociraptor , the Crested Venator has a massive retractable claw on its middle toes ( rear only ) . These are used to inflict severe damage and cut deep into flesh --- this claw can sometimes reach a frightening 14 inches long . Crested Venators tend to hiss and make a prominent , sharp clicking noise with their throats when threatened or excited . The name Venator literally means " hunter . "

D	= = Time Periods = = * ' ' ' Present day ( 2001 ) ' ' ' The time period the game begins in , and where most of the story progresses . Eike can travel to a few hours behind and ahead in this time . The town is in full colour though each time frame has a distinct colour palette from each other . * ' ' ' 1979-80 ' ' ' Roughly 22 years before present day . The town is barely different from in the present day , except snow is still falling . Eike travels here and enounters a young Mr. Brum , who is celebrating the birth of his daughter . 1 year later , Eike travels to this time when his life is threatened by vehicular homicide . Eike meets a young film director , who is burning out on ideas . A mysterious murder occurs and a woman's child is taken . 1979 is a blue tinted colour , while 1980 is roughly the same colour scheme as the present day . * ' ' ' 1902 ' ' ' Nearly a century before Eike's time , here Eike meets the ancestor of Mr. Brum . Winter has settled in , yet the town does not look very different . It is possible to change the future by suggesting the estate become a library or a museum . The world is all in monochrome , except Eike . * ' ' ' 1580 ' ' ' Eike is sent to this time early in the story , along with another person . This period is where another significant portion of the story unfolds . A simpler time , the town is still growing into what it will be in the future . Here Eike meets an aging alchemist hunting for knowledge , his son who hopes to follow in his footsteps and his daughter , who seems to have her eye on Eike and his ' future world ' . The color of the world is in sepiatone , whereas Eike remains in full color . * ' ' ' Void ' ' ' The home of Homunculus ( although not technically a time period ) . Eike finds himself here in the start of the story and each time he dies . It appears as a large portion of a floor , with various shelves , books , statues , and busts strewn about . A window can be seen looking into another world , and a solitary door returns Eike to his time . Though Eike only appears here in the outset of the story , it is possible to return , but only if the player reaches certain objectives . = = Themes = = Multiple themes are displayed throughout the story . The central theme is the concept of [ [ destiny | fate ] ] . Fate is defined as the final destiny of one's life , the end of the road in other words . It is inevitable , and is impossible to avoid . In Shadow of Memories , fate is portrayed quite literally ; it is the ultimate point in one's life . If someone dies , that is their fate ; if he is whisked away by some unknown figure , again it is fate . Yet , like many stories that use the device of Time Travel , it allows for flexibility in fate . Eike is able to deter his death by finding a way to avoid the killing blow with multiple means . Despite his attempts , Eike is only able to prolong his life for a while longer ; he cannot rest until he has unmasked his [ [ assassin ] ] . 
D	Time travel is the second theme . A theory in many studies , time travel is also used as plot device in many science-fiction novels , films and a few video games . Other concepts are small ideologies of [ [ existentialism ] ] . Eike and other characters occasionally ponder the meaning of their existence . Eike wishes to ensure his survival , and will do whatever he can to achieve it . A few other characters express the feeling of displacement and not fitting into their own time . Alongside this theme , each character has a goal in life . Eike wishes to preserve his life and stop his assailant , and uncover his / her reason for trying to kill him . Mr. Brum has a fleeting hope of finding his long-lost daughter . Dr. Wagner strives to find the Philosopher's stone and discover the secret of life . Margarete wants to see the future and find her true place in life . Hugo desires to be noticed by his father . The Homunculus wishes to help save Eike , though he may have more in mind than just being a helpful hand .

I	Network Analysis 
D	an ] ] and later [ [ J. Clyde Mitchell ] ] ) investigating community networks in southern Africa , India and the United Kingdom . Concomitantly , British anthropologist [ [ Siegfried Frederick Nadel | S.F. Nadel ] ] codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis . < ref > [ Nadel , SF . 1957 .

D	The Theory of Social Structure . ' ' London 
I	Empirical Press 
D	Cohen and West 
I	Precursors of social networks in the late 1800s include [ [ √ â mile Durkheim ] ] and [ [ Ferdinand T√ ∂ nnies ] ] . T√ ∂ nnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief ( ' ' gemeinschaft ' ' ) or impersonal , formal , and instrumental social links ( ' ' gesellschaft ' ' ) . Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors . He distinguished between a traditional society ‚Ä " " mechanical solidarity " ‚Ä " which prevails if individual differences are minimized , and the modern society ‚Ä " " organic solidarity " ‚Ä " that develops out of cooperation between differentiated individuals with independent roles . [ [ Georg Simmel ] ] , writing at the turn of the twentieth century , was the first scholar to think directly in social network terms . His essays pointed to the nature of network size on interaction and to the likelihood of interaction in ramified , loosely-knit networks rather than groups ( Simmel , 1908 / 1971 ) . After a hiatus in the first decades of the twentieth century , three main traditions in social networks appeared . 
I	1930s , [ [ Jacob L. Moreno | J.L. Moreno ] ] pioneered the systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups , especially classrooms and work groups ( [ [ sociometry ] ] ) , while a [ [ Harvard ] ] group led by [ [ W. Lloyd Warner ] ] and [ [ Elton Mayo ] ] explored interpersonal relations at work . In 1940 , A.R.

I	The first solar pond in India ( 6000 sq. metres ) was built at Bhuj . The project was sanctioned under the National Solar Pond Programme by the Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources in 1987 and completed in 1993 after a sustained collaborative effort by TERI , the Gujarat Energy Development Agency , and the GDDC ( Gujarat Dairy Development Corporation Ltd ) . The solar pond successfully demonstrated the expediency of the technology by supplying 80,000 litres of hot water daily to the plant . [ [ TERI | The Energy and resources Institute ] ] provided all technical inputs and took up the complete execution of research , development , and demonstration . TERI operated and maintained this facility until 1996 before handing it over to the GDDC . The solar pond functioned effortlessly till the year 2000 when severe financial losses crippled GDDC . Subsequently , the Bhuj earthquake left the Kutch Dairy non-functional . < ref > Solar Gradient Solar Ponds , accessed on 28 November 2009 , http : / / www . teriin.org / tech_solarponds . php < / ref >

Entering the ring with his trademark chain attached to a dog collar , to the music of Queen's " Another One Bites the Dust , " JYD was considered by some to be one of the most electrifying and charismatic wrestlers in the country , particularly during his peak in the early 1980s . He was one of the most popular athletes of any kind in Louisiana and other parts of the south during the 1980s , having regularly headlined cards that sold out The Louisiana Superdome and other major venues . JYD was most known for his head butt and upper-body strength , the latter of which saw him regularly body slam such large wrestlers as the [ [ One Man Gang ] ] , [ [ Kamala ( wrestler ) | Kamala ] ] , and [ [ King Kong Bundy ] ] .

[ http : / / www . en.wikipedia.org / wiki / Chet_Grimsley ] [ http : / / www . authorsden.com / visit / author / . asp ? authorid = 97758 ] = = = Professional wrestling = = = Ritter debuted in the Tennessee territory , working for promoter [ [ Jerry Jarrett ] ] , before moving to [ [ Nick Gulas ] ] 's company and using the [ [ ring name ] ] Leroy Rochester . From there he moved to [ [ Stu Hart ] ] 's [ [ Stampede Wrestling ] ] as Big Daddy Ritter , where he captured the [ [ Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship | North American Heavyweight Championship ] ] twice . In the early 1980s Ritter moved to [ [ Universal Wrestling Federation ( Bill Watts ) #Mid-South Wrestling | Mid-South Wrestling ] ] , where [ [ List of professional wrestling terms#B | booker ] ] [ [ Bill Watts | " Cowboy " Bill Watts ] ] gave him the name and [ [ List of professional wrestling terms#G | gimmick ] ] Junkyard Dog , as he would wear a long chain attached to a dog collar , and white boots . He originally came to the ring pushing a cart filled with [ [ Foreign object ( professional wrestling ) | junk ] ] called the " junk wagon " and [ [ Job ( professional wrestling ) | lost ] ] most of his early matches before his character caught on and became the top [ [ Face ( professional wrestling ) | face ] ] in the company . While on top he [ [ Feud ( professional wrestling ) | feuded ] ] with some of the top [ [ Heel ( professional wrestling ) | heels ] ] in the company , including a now infamous [ [ List of professional wrestling terms#A | angle ] ] with the [ [ Fabulous Freebirds ] ] where they blinded him with hair cream . At the peak of the feud JYD's wife gave birth to their first child , and since JYD now couldn't see his new daughter it increased the [ [ Heat ( professional wrestling ) | heat ] ] on the Freebirds to the point where they needed police escorts in and out of arenas . The feud ended with ( the still blind ) JYD and Freebird leader [ [ Michael Hayes ( wrestler ) | Michael " P.S. " Hayes ] ] wrestling in a dog collar match . Other notable feuds involved [ [ Ted DiBiase ] ] , [ [ Kamala ] ] , [ [ King Kong Bundy ] ] , and Hacksaw Butch Reed . The feud with DiBiase was particularly notable as DiBiase , once JYD's friend and tag-team partner , turned heel and subsequently won a [ [ Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match | loser-leave-town match ] ] against JYD with the help of the loaded glove , which was a DiBiase calling card , forcing JYD to leave town for an extended period of time . A masked man physically resembling JYD , known as Stagger Lee , subsequently appeared in the region and began to defeat the competition , one by one , including DiBiase . Though DiBiase and the other heels strongly suspected that Stagger Lee was in fact JYD , they were unable to unmask him to prove their suspicions . Stagger Lee disappeared once the loser-leave-town clause in the JYD-DiBiase match had expired , and JYD returned and reclaimed the North American Heavyweight Championship . The feud with Reed was notable in that Reed , a prot√©g√© of JYD , had turned heel . The two had a series of matches , many of which were bouts for the prized North American Heavyweight Championship . These matches were also notable for their brutality , which included " ghetto street fights , " " dog-collar matches , " two-out-of-three pin-fall matches and steel-cage matches . JYD was lured to the WWF at the peak of the feud with Reed . Late in 1984 , Ritter left Mid-South for [ [ World Wrestling Entertainment | the World Wrestling Federation ] ] , where he was still an [ [ List of professional wrestling terms#O | over ] ] face . While in the WWF , JYD made a habit of interacting with the growing number of young people in attendance , often bringing them into the ring after matches and dancing with them . Ritter won ' ' [ [ WWF The Wrestling Classic | The Wrestling Classic ] ] ' ' tournament , often cited as the first-ever WWF [ [ pay-per-view ] ] and his most notable feuds in the company came against [ [ Harley Race | King Harley Race ] ] , the Funk Brothers , [ [ Adrian Adonis ] ] , [ [ Greg Valentine | Greg " The Hammer " Valentine ] ] and [ [ Ronald Herd | " Outlaw " Ron Bass ] ] before he left the company late in 1988. In 1990 he had a brief run in [ [ World Championship Wrestling ] ] while it was still under the [ [ National Wrestling Alliance ] ] banner , where he feuded with [ [ Ric Flair ] ] over the [ [ NWA World Heavyweight Championship ] ] and won the Six-Man Tag Team Championship with [ [ Ricky Morton ] ] and [ [ Tommy Rich ] ] . = = = Death = = = Ritter died on June 2 , 1998 , in a single-car accident on [ [ Interstate 20 ] ] near [ [ Forest , Mississippi ] ] , as he was returning home from his daughter Latoya's high school graduation in [ [ Wadesboro , North Carolina ] ] .

Brewer publicized his new instruments in an article in the Wichita Beacon , October 2 , 1932 and through performances that month . The first recordings using the electric guitar were made by Hawaiian Style players such as Andy Iona as early as 1933 . Bob Dunn of Milton Brown's Musical Brownies introduced the electric [ [ Hawaiian guitar ] ] to [ [ Western Swing ] ] with his January 1935 Decca recordings , departing almost entirely from Hawaiian musical influence and heading towards Jazz and Blues .

An early proponent of the electric Spanish guitar was jazz guitarist [ [ George Barnes ( musician ) | George Barnes ] ] who used the instrument in two songs recorded in Chicago on March 1 , 1938 , ' ' Sweetheart Land ' ' and ' ' It's a Low-Down Dirty Shame ' ' .

" < / ref > Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include : Jack Miller ( Orville Knapp Orch. ) , Alvino Rey ( Phil Spitalney Orch. ) , Les Paul ( Fred Warring Orch. ) , Danny Stewart ( Andy Iona Orchestra ) , George Barnes ( under many alias ) , Floyd Smith , Bill Broonzy , T-Bone Walker , George Van Eps , Charlie Christian ( Benny Goodman Orch. ) Tampa Red , Memphis Minnie , and Arthur Cruddup . Early electric guitar manufacturers include : [ [ Rickenbacker ] ] ( first called Ro-Pat-In ) in 1932 , Dobro in 1933 , National , [ [ AudioVox ] ] and Volu-tone in 1934 , Vega , Epiphone ( Electrophone and Electar ) , and Gibson in 1935 and many others by 1936 . The version of the instrument that is best known today is the [ [ solid body ] ] electric guitar , a guitar made of solid wood , without resonating air spaces within it . Rickenbacher , later spelled [ [ Rickenbacker ] ] , did , however , offer a cast aluminum electric steel guitar , nicknamed [ [ Frying pan ( guitar ) | ' ' ' The Frying Pan ' ' ' ] ] or ' ' ' The Pancake Guitar ' ' ' , developed in 1931 with production beginning in the summer of 1932 . This guitar sounds quite modern and aggressive as tested by vintage guitar researcher John Teagle . The company [ [ Audiovox ] ] built and may have offered an electric solid-body as early as the mid-1930s . Another early solid body electric guitar was designed and built by musician and inventor [ [ Les Paul ] ] in the early 1940s , working after hours in the [ [ Epiphone | Epiphone Guitar ] ] factory . His ' ' ' log guitar ' ' ' ( so called because it consisted of a simple 4x4 wood post with a neck attached to it and homemade pickups and hardware , with two detachable Swedish hollow body halves attached to the sides for appearance only ) was patented and is often considered to be the first of its kind , although it shares nothing in design or hardware with the solid body " Les Paul " model sold by Gibson . In 1945 , Richard D. Bourgerie made an electric guitar pickup and amplifier for professional guitar player George Barnes . Bourgerie worked through World War II at Howard Radio Company making electronic equipment for the American military . Mr. Barnes showed the result to Les Paul , who then arranged for Mr. Bourgerie to have one made for him . = = = Fender = = = { { Main | Fender Musical Instruments Corporation } } [ [ File : Fenderguitarpatentsketch . png | left | thumb | Sketch of Fender lap steel guitar from 1944 patent application . ] ] In 1946 , radio repairman and instrument amplifier maker [ [ Clarence Leonidas Fender ] ] ‚Ä " better known as Leo Fender‚Ä " through his eponymous company , designed the first commercially successful solid-body electric guitar with a single magnetic pickup , which was initially named the " [ [ Fender Esquire | Esquire ] ] " . This was a departure from the typically hollow-bodied Jazz-oriented instruments of the time and immediately found favor with Country-Western artists in California . The two-pickup version of the Esquire was called the " Broadcaster " . However , [ [ Gretsch ] ] had a drumset marketed with a similar name ( Broadkaster ) , so Fender changed the name to " [ [ Fender Telecaster | Telecaster ] ] " . Features of the Telecaster included : an ash body ; a maple 25¬ " " scale , 21-fret or 22-fret neck attached to the body with four-bolts reinforced by a steel neckplate ; two single-coil , 6-pole pickups ( bridge and neck positions ) with tone and volume knobs , pickup selector switch ; and an output jack mounted on the side of the body . A black bakelite pickguard concealed body routings for pickups and wiring . The bolt-on neck was consistent with Leo Fender's belief that the instrument design should be modular to allow cost-effective and consistent manufacture and assembly , as well as simple repair or replacement . Due to the earlier mentioned trademark issue , some of the first production Telecasters were delivered with headstock decals with the Fender logo but no model identification . These are today very much sought after , and commonly referred to by collectors as " Nocasters " . [ [ File : 06192009 StratVox . JPG | thumb | right | A 2004 maple necked Fender Stratocaster next to a Vox amplifier . ] ] In 1954 , Fender introduced the [ [ Fender Stratocaster ] ] , or " Strat . " The Stratocaster was seen as a deluxe model and offered various product improvements and innovations over the Telecaster . These innovations included a well dried ash or alder double-cutaway body design for bridge assembly with an integrated spring [ [ vibrato ] ] mechanism ( called a ' ' [ [ Synchronized tremolo#Fender synchronized tremolo | synchronized tremolo ] ] ' ' by Fender , thus beginning a confusion of the terms that still continues ) , three single-coil pickups , and body comfort contours .

Vox guitars also experimented with onboard effects and electronics . In the mid 1960s , as the sound of electric 12-string guitars became popular , Vox introduced the Phantom XII and Mark XII electric 12-string guitars as well as the Tempest XII which employed a more conventional Fender style body and thus is often overlooked as a Vox classic from the Sixties . The few that were manufactured also came from Italy . Vox also produced other traditional styles of 6 - and 12-string electric guitars in both England and Italy , The 12-string electric guitars had a much larger neck and body and averaged at the weight of 26.4 pounds ( 11 . 9&nbsp ; kg ) , they were also played on tables such as a piano or other sit down instrument . = = Construction = = [ [ image : Electric Guitar ( Superstrat based on ESP KH - vertical ) - with hint lines and numbers . png | thumb | Legend : 1 .

[ [ Strings ( music ) | Strings ] ] : 4.1 bass strings 4.2 treble strings . ] ] While guitar construction has many variations , in terms of the materials used for the body , the shape of the body , and the configuration of the neck , bridge , and pickups , there are features which are found in almost every guitar . The photo below shows the different parts of an electric guitar . The [ [ headstock ] ] ( 1 ) contains the metal machine heads , which are used for tuning ; the [ [ nut ( string instrument ) | nut ] ] ( 1.4 ) , a thin fret-like strip of metal or plastic which the strings pass over as they first go onto the fingerboard ; the [ [ machine head ] ] s ( 1.1 ) , which are [ [ worm gear ] ] s which the player turns to change the string tension and thus adjust the tuning ; the [ [ frets ] ] ( 2.3 ) , which are thin metal strips which stop the string at the correct pitch when a string is pressed down against the fingerboard ; the [ [ truss rod ] ] ( 1.2 ) , a metal cylinder used for adjusting the tension on the neck ( not found on all instruments ) ; decorative inlay ( 2.2 ) , a feature not found on lower-cost instruments . The [ [ neck ( guitar ) | neck ] ] and the [ [ fretboard ] ] ( 2.1 ) extend from the body ; at the neck joint ( 2.4 ) , the neck is either glued or bolted to the body ; the body ( 3 ) of this instrument is made of wood which is painted and lacquered , but some guitar bodies are also made of polycarbonate or other materials ; [ [ Pickup ( music technology ) | pickups ] ] ( 3.1 , 3.2 ) , which are usually magnetic pickups , but which may also be [ [ piezoelectric ] ] transducer pickups ; the control knobs ( 3.8 ) for the volume and tone [ [ potentiometer ] ] s ; a fixed [ [ bridge ( guitar ) | bridge ] ] ( 3.4 ) - on some guitars , a spring-loaded hinged bridge called a " [ [ tremolo ] ] system " is used instead , which allows players to " bend " notes or chords down in pitch or perform a vibrato embellishment ; and a plastic [ [ pickguard ] ] , a feature not found on all guitars , which is used to protect the body from scratches . The wood that the body ( 3 ) is made of is a very disputed subject considered by some to largely determine the sonic qualities of the guitar , while others believe that the sonic difference in a solid body guitar is very subtle between woods . In acoustic and archtop guitars there is a more pronounced sonic definition caused by the type of wood used . Typical woods include alder ( brighter , but well rounded ) , swamp ash ( similar to alder , but with more pronounced highs and lows ) , mahogany ( dark , bassy , warm ) , poplar ( similar to alder ) and basswood ( very neutral ) . Maple , a very bright tonewood , is also a popular body wood , but is very heavy . For this reason it is often placed as a ' cap ' on a guitar made of primarily of another wood . Cheaper guitars are often made of cheaper woods , such as plywood , pine or agathis , not true hardwoods , which can affect the durability and tone of the guitar . = = = Pickups = = = { { Main | Pick up ( music technology ) } } Compared with an acoustic guitar , which has a hollow body , electric guitars make comparatively little audible sound simply by having their strings plucked , and so electric guitars are normally plugged into a guitar amplifier , which makes the sound louder . When an electric guitar is strummed , the movement of the strings generates ( i.e. , " induces " ) a very small electrical current in the magnetic pickups , which are [ [ magnet ] ] s wrapped with coils of very fine wire . That current is then sent through a cable to a guitar amplifier . < ref > [ http : / / www . europhysicsnews.com / full / 10 / article2 / article2 . html Physics ... in action < ! -- Bot generated title -- > ] < / ref > The current induced is proportional to such factors as the density of the string or the amount of movement over these pickups . That vibration is , in turn , affected by several factors , such as the composition and shape of the body . [ [ File : Pickups Humb 2Single . jpg | thumb | A close-up of the pickups on a Fender Squier " Fat Strat " guitar ; on the left is a " humbucker " pickup and on the right are two single-coil pickups . ] ] Some " hybrid " electric-acoustic guitars are equipped with additional [ [ microphone ] ] s or [ [ piezoelectric ] ] pickups ( [ [ transducer ] ] s ) that sense mechanical vibration from the body . Because in some cases it is desirable to isolate the pickups from the vibrations of the strings , a guitar's magnetic pickups will sometimes be embedded or " potted " in epoxy or wax to prevent the pickup from having a microphonic effect . Because of their natural inductive qualities , all magnetic pickups tend to pick up ambient and usually unwanted electromagnetic noises . The resulting noise , the so-called " [ [ hum ] ] " , is particularly strong with single-coil pickups , and aggravated by the fact that very few guitars are correctly shielded against electromagnetic interference . The most frequent cause is the strong 50 or 60 [ [ Hertz | Hz ] ] component that is inherent in the generation of electricity in the local [ [ Electric power transmission | power transmission ] ] system . As nearly all amplifiers and audio equipment associated with electrical guitars rely on this power , there is in theory little chance of completely eliminating the introduction of unwanted hum . Double-coil or " [ [ humbucker ] ] " pickups were invented as a way to reduce or counter the unwanted ambient hum sounds ( known as 60 cycle hum ) . Humbuckers have two coils of opposite magnetic and electric polarity . This means that electromagnetic noise hitting both coils should cancel itself out . The two coils are wired in phase , so the signal picked up by each coil is added together . This creates the richer , " fatter " tone associated with humbucking pickups .

Early vibrato systems , such as the [ [ Bigsby vibrato tailpiece ] ] , tended to be unreliable and cause the guitar to go out of tune quite easily , and also had a limited range . Later [ [ Fender Musical Instruments Corporation | Fender ] ] designs were better , but Fender held the patent on these , so other companies used Bigsby-style vibrato for many years . [ [ File : Stratocaster detail DSC06937 . jpg | thumb | left | Detail of a Squier-made Fender Stratocaster . Note the vibrato arm , the 3 single-coil pickups , the volume and tone knobs . ] ] With the expiration of the Fender patent on the [ [ Stratocaster ] ] - style vibrato , various improvements on this type of internal , multi-spring vibrato system are now available . [ [ Floyd Rose ] ] introduced one of the first improvements on the vibrato system in many years when in the late 1970s he began to experiment with " locking " nuts and bridges which work to prevent the guitar from losing tuning even under the most heavy whammy bar acrobatics . = = = Guitar necks = = = Electric guitar necks can vary according to composition as well as shape . The primary metric used to describe a guitar neck is the ' ' scale ' ' , which is the overall length of the strings from the nut to the bridge . A typical Fender guitar uses a 25 . 5&nbsp ; inch scale , while Gibson uses a 24 . 75&nbsp ; inch scale in their ' ' [ [ Gibson Les Paul | Les Paul ] ] ' ' . While Gibson's scale has often claimed to be 24.75 " , it has varied through the years by as much as a half inch . The frets are placed proportionally according to the scale length ; thus , the smaller the scale , the tighter the spacing of the frets . Necks are described as ' ' [ [ bolt-on neck | bolt-on ] ] ' ' , ' ' [ [ set-in neck | set-in ] ] ' ' , or ' ' [ [ neck-through ] ] ' ' depending on how they are attached to the body . Set-in necks are glued to the body in the factory , and are said to have a warmer tone and greater sustain ; this is the most traditional type of joint . Bolt-on necks were pioneered by [ [ Leo Fender ] ] to facilitate easy adjustment and replacement of the guitar neck . Neck-through instruments extend the neck itself to form the center of the guitar body , and are known for long sustain and for being particularly sturdy . While a set neck can be carefully unglued by a skilled [ [ luthier ] ] , and a bolt-on neck can simply be unscrewed , a neck-through design is difficult or even impossible to repair , depending on the damage . Historically , the bolt-on style has been more popular for ease of installation and adjustment ; since bolt-on necks can be easily removed , there is an after-market in replacement bolt-on necks from companies such as Warmoth and Mighty Mite . Some instruments , notably most Gibson models , have continued to use set / glued necks . Neck-through bodies are somewhat more common in [ [ bass guitar ] ] s. The materials used in the manufacture of the neck have great influence over the tone of the instrument . Hardwoods are very much preferred , with [ [ maple ] ] , [ [ ash ( tree ) | ash ] ] , and [ [ mahogany ] ] topping the list . The neck and fingerboard can be made from different materials , such as a maple neck with a [ [ rosewood ] ] fingerboard . In the 1980s , exotic man-made materials such as graphite began to be used , but are pricey and never have replaced wood in production instruments . Such necks can be retrofitted to existing bolt-on instruments . There are several different neck shapes used on guitars , including shapes known as C necks , U necks , and V necks . These refer to the cross-sectional shape of the neck ( especially near the nut ) . There are also several sizes of fret wire available , with traditional players often preferring thin frets , and metal shredders liking thick frets . Thin frets are considered better for playing chords , while thick frets allow lead guitarists to bend notes with less effort . An electric guitar with a neck which folds back called the " Foldaxe " was designed and built for Chet Atkins by Roger Field ( featured in Atkins ' book " Me and My Guitars . " ) . [ [ Steinberger ] ] guitars developed a line of exotic instruments without headstocks , with tuning done on the bridge instead . = = = Sound and effects = = = While an [ [ Steel-string acoustic guitar | acoustic guitar ] ] 's sound is largely dependent on the vibration of the guitar's body and the air within it , the sound of an electric guitar is largely dependent on a magnetically induced [ [ electrical signal ] ] , generated by the vibration of metal strings near sensitive pickups . The signal is then " [ [ Shaping | shaped ] ] " on its path to the [ [ amplifier ] ] by using a range of effect devices or circuits that modify the tone and characteristics of the signal . The most basic sound-shaping circuitry are the volume control ( potentiometer ) , tone control ( which " rolls off " the treble frequencies ) , and the pick-up selectors which are found on most electric guitars , and the gain and tone ( usually consisting of at least bass and treble ) controls on the guitar amplifier . In the 1960s , some guitarists began exploring a wider range of tonal effects by [ [ Distortion ( guitar ) | distorting ] ] the sound of the instrument . To do this , they increased the [ [ gain ] ] , or [ [ volume ] ] , of the [ [ Pre amplifier | preamplifier ] ] , which produced a " fuzzy " sound . This effect is called " clipping " by sound engineers , because when viewed with an oscilloscope , the wave forms of a distorted signal appear to have had their peaks " clipped " off . This was not actually a new development in the instrument , but rather a shift of aesthetics . This sound was not generally recognized previously as desirable . In the 1960s , the [ [ timbre | tonal palette ] ] of the electric guitar was further modified by introducing an [ [ Effects unit | effects box ] ] in its signal path . Traditionally built in a small metal chassis with an on / off foot switch , such " [ [ stomp box ] ] es " have become an important part of the electric guitar tone in many genres . Typical effects include [ [ chorus effect | stereo chorus ] ] , [ [ fuzz ( electric guitar ) | fuzz ] ] , [ [ Wah-wah pedal | wah-wah ] ] and [ [ flanging ] ] , [ [ compression ( electric guitar ) | compression / sustain ] ] , [ [ Delay ( audio effect ) | delay ] ] , [ [ reverberation | reverb ] ] , and [ [ phaser ( effect ) | phase shift ] ] . Not all special effects are electronic ; in 1967 , guitarist [ [ Jimmy Page ] ] of [ [ The Yardbirds ] ] and [ [ Led Zeppelin ] ] created unusual , psychedelic sound effects by playing the electric guitar using a violin bow with a delay pedal and wah pedal [ [ File : DS 1 Distortion . jpg | thumb | left | A Boss " stomp-box " - style distortion pedal in use . ] ] In the 1970s , as effects pedals proliferated , their sounds were combined with tube distortion at lower , more controlled volumes by using [ [ Attenuator ( electronics ) | power attenuators ] ] such as Tom Scholz ' Power Soak as well as re-amplified dummy loads such as Eddie Van Halen's use of a [ [ variac ] ] , power resistor , post-power-tube effects , and a final solid-state amp driving the guitar speakers . A [ [ variac ] ] is one approach to power-supply based power attenuation , to make the sound of power-tube distortion more practically available . By the 1980s and 1990s , digital and software effects became capable of replicating the analog effects used in the past . These new digital effects attempted to model the sound produced by analog effects and tube amps , to varying degrees of quality . There are many free guitar effects computer programs for computers that can be downloaded via the Internet . Now , computers with sound cards can be used as digital guitar effects processors . Although digital and software effects offer many advantages , many guitarists still use analog effects . In 2002 , Gibson announced the first digital guitar , which performs analog-to-digital conversion internally . The resulting digital signal is delivered over a standard [ [ Ethernet ] ] cable , eliminating cable-induced line noise . The guitar also provides independent signal processing for each individual string . Also , in 2003 [ [ instrument amplifier | amp ] ] maker [ [ Line 6 ] ] released the [ [ Variax ] ] guitar . It differs in some fundamental ways from conventional solid-body electrics . For example it uses [ [ Pick up ( music technology ) | piezoelectric pickups ] ] instead of the conventional electromagnetic ones , and has an on-board computer capable of modifying the sound of the guitar to model the sound of many instruments . = = = Extended playing techniques = = = [ [ File : myprepguitar . jpg | thumb | A [ [ prepared guitar ] ] ] ] The sound of a guitar is not only adapted by electronic sound effects , but also heavily by all kinds of new techniques developed or becoming possible in combination with the electric amplification . This is called [ [ extended technique ] ] . Famous extended techniques are the use of the tremolo , as mentioned above , playing [ [ harmonics ] ] , [ [ palm muting ] ] , [ [ shred guitar ] ] , [ [ tapping ] ] , [ [ pinch harmonic ] ] , [ [ dive bomb ] ] . These are all common techniques mainly used in hard rock and heavy metal . Also other techniques exist , such as playing with [ [ audio feedback ] ] and [ [ alternate tunings ] ] . Sometimes guitars are even adapted with extra modifications to alter the sound , examples : usage of the [ [ slide ( guitar technique ) | slide ] ] , [ [ prepared guitar ] ] and [ [ 3rd Bridge | 3rd bridge ] ] . = = Types = = = = = Solid body = = = Solid body electric guitars have no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration and no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in [ [ acoustic guitar ] ] s. Solid body instruments are generally made of hardwood with a lacquer coating and have six steel strings . The wood is dried for 3 to 6 months in heated storage before being cut to shape . The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal . The signal is then fed to an [ [ amplifier ] ] ( or amp ) and [ [ Computer speaker | speaker ] ] . One of the first solid body guitars was invented by [ [ Les Paul ] ] . [ [ Gibson Guitar Corporation | Gibson ] ] did not present their ' [ [ Gibson Les Paul | Les Paul ] ] ' guitar prototypes to the public , as they did not believe it would catch on . The first mass-produced solid-body guitar was [ [ Fender Musical Instruments Corporation | Fender ] ] 's Broadcaster ( later to become the ' [ [ Telecaster ] ] ' ) first made in 1948 , five years after Les Paul made his [ [ prototype ] ] . The Gibson Les Paul appeared soon after to compete with the Broadcaster . < ref > Alan Ratcliffe , ' ' Electric Guitar Handbook ' ' ( UK : New Holland Publishers , 2005 ) , p. 11 < / ref > = = = = String-through body = = = = When discussing electric guitar construction , the term ' ' ' string-through body ' ' ' is used to describe a type of solid body electric guitar body in which the strings are threaded through holes drilled into the bottom of the guitar body . The strings are typically held in place using metal [ [ ferrule ] ] s screwed or glued into the holes . The advantages of a string-through body mostly relate to improvements in a guitar's [ [ sustain ] ] and [ [ timbre ] ] . However , this type of body also significantly increases the tension placed on the strings , which can cause wear or bowing on the guitar neck over time . It is also by nature impossible to install a [ [ tremolo arm ] ] on a string-through body . Examples of string-through bodies on guitars include the [ [ Fender Telecaster Thinline ] ] and [ [ Fender Telecaster Deluxe | Telecaster Deluxe ] ] . = = = Semi-acoustic = = = { { Anchor | Hollow body } } { { Main | Semi-acoustic guitar } } [ [ File : Guitard Epiphone 03 . jpg | thumb | right | 150 px | An Epiphone brand semi-acoustic hollow-body guitar . ] ] These guitars have a hollow body and electronic pickups mounted on its body . They work in a similar way to solid body electric guitars except that because the hollow body also vibrates , the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal . A variant form , the semi-hollow body guitar , strikes a balance between the characteristics of solid-body and hollow-body guitars . Advocates of semi-hollow-body guitars { { Who | date = December 2008 } } argue that they have greater resonance and sustain than true solid-body guitars , < ref > Dave Hunter , ' ' Chambering the Les Paul : A Marriage of Weight and Tone ' ' ( Gibson Lifestyle , 2007 ) , { { cite web | url = http : / / www . gibson.com / en-us / Lifestyle / ProductSpotlight / GearAndInstruments / Chambering%20the%20Les%20Paul_%20A%20Mar / | title = Chambering the Les Paul : A Marriage of Weight and Tone } } < / ref > { { Failed verification | date = December 2008 } } as well as lighter overall weight . Typically , a semi-hollow body guitar will have a form factor more similar to a solid-body electric guitar , and may include two sound holes , one , or none . A number of metal-bodied guitars have worked with the unique acoustic / sustaining qualities of metal . These are not hollow-bodied guitars , like a blues steel-bodied guitar , although most are chambered for weight ; instead , these metal-bodied guitars are built to play as a solid wood body . Several metal bodies were made in the 1950s by violin and cello makers . In the 1970s , John Veleno made a polished aluminum guitar . Liquid Metal Guitars makes a metal body guitar made out of a solid block of aluminum and then chrome or gold-plates the instrument . Many guitars otherwise sold as solid-bodied instruments , such as the [ [ Gibson Les Paul ] ] or the [ [ PRS Guitars | PRS ] ] Singlecut , are built with " weight relief " holes bored into the body which affect the sound of the instrument < ref > { { cite web | title = Les Paul Forum Frequently Asked Questions | url = http : / / www . lespaulforum.com / faqpage . html#weighti } } < / ref > . The Les Paul Supreme edition is currently described by the manufacturer as a " chambered " instrument , with a weight relief system designed to positively affect the sound . = = = Electric acoustic = = = { { main | Electric acoustic guitar } } Some [ [ steel-string acoustic guitar ] ] s are fitted with [ [ Pick up ( music technology ) | pickups ] ] purely as an alternative to using a separate microphone . They may also be fitted with a [ [ Piezo-electricity | piezo-electric ] ] pickup under the bridge , attached to the bridge mounting plate , or with a low mass [ [ microphone ] ] ( usually a condenser mic ) inside the body of the guitar that will convert the vibrations in the body into electronic signals , or even combinations of these types of pickups , with an integral mixer / preamp / graphic equalizer . These are called [ [ electric acoustic guitar ] ] s , and are regarded as acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars because the pickups do not produce a signal directly from the vibration of the strings , but rather from the vibration of the guitar top or body . These should not be confused with [ [ semi-acoustic guitar ] ] s , which have pickups of the type found on solid body electric guitars . = = = String , bridge , and neck variants = = = Although rare , the one-string guitar is sometimes heard , particularly in [ [ Delta blues ] ] , where improvised folk instruments were popular in the 1930s and 1940s .

In a more contemporary style , Little Willie Joe , the inventor of the Unitar , had a [ [ rhythm and blues ] ] [ [ instrumental ] ] hit in the 1950s with " Twitchy " , recorded with the Hall Orchestra . The best-known exponent of the four-string guitar , often called the [ [ tenor guitar ] ] was [ [ Tiny Grimes ] ] , who played on [ [ 52nd Street ( Manhattan ) | 52nd Street ] ] with the [ [ bebop ] ] pers and played a major role in the Prestige Blues Swingers .

Many banjo players use this tuning : DGBE , mostly in Dixieland . Guitar players find this an easier transition than learning plectrum or tenor tuning . = = = = Seven-string = = = = { { Main | Seven-string guitar } } Most Seven-string guitars add a low " B " string below the low " E " . Both electric and [ [ classical guitar ] ] s exist designed for this tuning . A high " A " string above the high " E " instead of the low " B " is sometimes used . Another less common seven-string arrangement is a second G string situated beside the standard G string and tuned an octave higher , in the same manner as a twelve-stringed guitar ( see below ) . [ [ Jazz guitarist ] ] s using a seven-string include veteran jazz guitarists [ [ George Van Eps ] ] , [ [ Bucky Pizzarelli ] ] and his son [ [ John Pizzarelli ] ] . Seven-string electric guitars were popularized among rock players in the 1980s by [ [ Steve Vai ] ] . Along with the Japanese guitar company [ [ Ibanez ] ] , Vai created the [ [ Ibanez Universe | Universe ] ] series seven string guitars in the 1980s , with a double locking tremolo system for a seven string guitar . These models were based on Vai's six string signature series , the [ [ Ibanez Jem ] ] . Seven-string guitars experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2000s , championed by [ [ Slayer ] ] , [ [ KoRn ] ] , [ [ Fear Factory ] ] , [ [ Strapping Young Lad ] ] , [ [ Nevermore ] ] , and other [ [ hard rock ] ] / [ [ heavy metal music | metal ] ] bands . Metal musicians often prefer the seven-string guitar for its extended lower range . The seven-string guitar has also played an essential role in progressive rock , and is commonly used in bands such as [ [ Dream Theater ] ] and by experimental guitarists such as Ben Levin . = = = = Eight and nine-string = = = = { { Main | Eight string guitar } } Eight-string electric guitars are rare , but not unused . One is played by [ [ Charlie Hunter ] ] ( manufactured by [ [ Novax Guitars ] ] ) . The largest manufacturer of 8 - to 14-strings is Warr Guitars . Their models are used by [ [ Trey Gunn ] ] ( ex [ [ King Crimson ] ] ) who has his own ' ' signature ' ' line from the company . Also , [ [ M√•rten Hagstr√ ∂ m ] ] and [ [ Fredrik Thordendal ] ] of [ [ Meshuggah ] ] used 8-string guitars made by Nevborn Guitars and now guitars by [ [ Ibanez ] ] . [ [ Munky ] ] of [ [ nu metal ] ] band [ [ KoRn ] ] is also known to use seven-string Ibanez guitars and it is rumored that he is planning to release a K8 eight-string guitar similar to his K7 seven-string guitar . [ [ Stephen Carpenter ] ] of [ [ Deftones ] ] also switched from 7 to 8 string in 2008 and released his signature STEF B-8 with [ [ ESP Guitars ] ] . In 2008 Ibanez released the Ibanez RG2228-GK which is the first mass produced eight-string guitar . [ [ Jethro Tull ( band ) | Jethro Tull ] ] 's first album uses a nine-string guitar on one track . [ [ Minarik Guitars ] ] manufactures the " Inferno V " 9 stringed guitar that has the top three strings doubled up with strings that are an octave higher , like 12 stringed guitars . [ [ Bill Kelliher ] ] , guitarist for the [ [ Heavy metal music | heavy metal ] ] group [ [ Mastodon ( band ) | Mastodon ] ] , worked with [ [ First Act ] ] on a custom mass-produced nine-string guitar . Andy Woodd from NZ Metal band Cripple Mr Onion uses his own custom designed 8 string . This gives Cripple Mr Onions albums their distinct sound . = = = = Ten-string = = = = { { Main | Ten-string guitar } } [ [ B . C.Rich ] ] manufacture a ten-string six - [ [ course ( music ) | course ] ] electric guitar known as the ' ' Bich ' ' , whose radical shape was specifically designed to allow the machine heads for the four secondary strings to be positioned on the body , avoiding the head-heaviness of many electric twelve-string guitars . However many players bought it for the body shape or electrics and simply removed the extra strings . The company recognized this and released six-string models of the Bich , but ten-string models also remain in production . In October 2008 , a ten-string electric [ [ jazz guitar ] ] by [ [ Mike Shishkov ] ] was demonstrated at the 3rd International Ten String Guitar Festival . This instrument was based on the ten-string [ [ extended-range classical guitar ] ] . = = = = Twelve-string = = = = { { Main | Twelve-string guitar } } Twelve string electric guitars feature six pairs of strings , usually with each pair tuned to the same note . The extra E , A , D , and G strings add a note one octave above , and the extra B and E strings are in unison . The pairs of strings are played together as one , so the technique and tuning are the same as a conventional guitar , although creating a much fuller tone . They are used almost solely to play harmony and rhythm . They are relatively common in [ [ folk rock ] ] music . [ [ Lead Belly ] ] is the folk artist most identified with the twelve-string guitar , usually acoustic with a pickup . [ [ George Harrison ] ] of [ [ The Beatles ] ] and [ [ Roger McGuinn ] ] of [ [ The Byrds ] ] brought the electric twelve-string to notability in [ [ rock and roll ] ] . During the Beatles ' first trip to the US , in February 1964 , Harrison received a new " [ [ Rickenbacker 360 / 12 | 360 / 12 ] ] " model guitar from the [ [ Rickenbacker ] ] company , a 12-string electric made to look onstage like a 6-string . He began using the 360 in the studio on Lennon's " You Can't Do That " and other songs . Roger McGuinn began using electric 12-string guitars to create the jangly sound of The Byrds . Another notable guitarist to utilize electric 12-string guitars is [ [ Jimmy Page ] ] , the guitarist with hard rock-heavy metal and rock group Led Zeppelin . = = = = 3rd bridge = = = = { { Main | 3rd bridge } } The 3rd bridge guitar is an electric [ [ prepared guitar ] ] with an additional 3rd bridge . This can be a normal guitar with for instance a screwdriver placed under the strings , but can also be a [ [ custom made instrument ] ] . [ [ Lee Ranaldo ] ] of [ [ Sonic Youth ] ] plays with a 3rd bridge . = = = = Double neck guitar = = = = { { Main | Double neck guitar } } [ [ Image : Gibson EDS1275 . jpg | thumb | right | 200px | A white [ [ Gibson EDS-1275 ] ] ] ] [ [ Double neck guitar | Double neck ] ] ( or , less commonly , " twin-neck " ) guitars enable guitarists to play guitar and bass guitar or , more commonly , a six-string and [ [ twelve-string guitar | twelve-string ] ] . An early user was [ [ John McLaughlin ] ] , but the double-neck guitar was popularized by [ [ Jimmy Page ] ] , who used a custom-made [ [ Gibson EDS-1275 ] ] to perform the " [ [ Stairway to Heaven ] ] " and " The Song Remains the Same " . [ [ Don Felder ] ] also used the Gibson EDS-1275 during the [ [ Hotel California ] ] tour . = = Uses = = = = = Popular music = = = [ [ Popular music ] ] and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles : as a [ [ rhythm guitar ] ] which provides the [ [ Chord ( music ) | chord ] ] sequence or " [ [ Chord progression | progression ] ] " and sets out the " [ [ Beat ( music ) | beat ] ] " ( as part of a [ [ rhythm section ] ] ) , and a [ [ lead guitar ] ] , which is used to perform [ [ melody ] ] lines , melodic [ [ fill ( music ) | instrumental fill passages ] ] , and [ [ guitar solo ] ] s. In some rock or metal bands with two guitarists , the two performers may perform as a [ [ multiple guitar players | guitar tandem ] ] , and trade off the lead guitar and rhythm guitar roles . In bands with a single guitarist , the guitarist may switch between these two roles , playing chords to accompany the singer's lyrics , and then playing a guitar solo in the middle of the song . In the most commercially available and consumed pop and rock genres , electric guitars tend to dominate their [ [ Acoustic guitar | acoustic ] ] cousins in both the [ [ recording studio ] ] and the live venue , especially in the " harder " genres such as [ [ Heavy metal music | heavy metal ] ] and [ [ hard rock ] ] . However the [ [ acoustic guitar ] ] remains a popular choice in [ [ country music | country ] ] , [ [ western music | western ] ] and especially [ [ bluegrass music ] ] , and it is widely used in [ [ folk music ] ] . = = = Jazz and jazz fusion = = = [ [ Jazz guitar ] ] playing styles include [ [ rhythm guitar ] ] - style " [ [ comping ] ] " ( accompanying ) with jazz chord [ [ voicing ( music ) | voicings ] ] ( and in some cases , [ [ walking bass ] ] lines ) and " blowing " ( improvising solos ) over jazz [ [ chord progression ] ] s with jazz-style phrasing and ornaments . The accompanying style for electric guitar in most [ [ jazz ] ] styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music . In rock and pop , the rhythm guitarist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat of a tune . In contrast , in many modern jazz styles , the guitarist plays much more sparsely , intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo . Jazz chord voicings are usually [ [ root ( chord ) | rootless ] ] and emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord . When jazz guitar players [ [ improvisation | improvise ] ] , they use the scales , modes , and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression . Jazz guitarists have to learn how to use scales ( whole tone scale , chromatic scale , etc. ) to solo over chord progressions . Jazz guitar improvising is not merely the recitation of jazz scales and rapid arpeggios . Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players . As well , a jazz guitarists ' solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and " time feel " that creates a sense of " [ [ swing ( jazz performance style ) | swing ] ] " and " [ [ groove ( music ) | groove ] ] " . Most jazz guitarists play hollow body instruments , but solid body guitars are also used . Hollow body instruments were the first guitars used in jazz in the 1930s and 1940s . During the 1970s [ [ jazz fusion ] ] era , many jazz guitarists switched to the solid body guitars that dominated the rock world . = = = Contemporary classical music = = = Until the 1950s , the acoustic , nylon-stringed [ [ classical guitar ] ] was the only type of guitar favored by classical , or [ [ art music ] ] composers . In the 1950s a few [ [ Contemporary classical music | contemporary classical ] ] composers began to use the electric guitar in their compositions . Examples of such works include [ [ Karlheinz Stockhausen ] ] 's ' ' [ [ Gruppen ( Stockhausen ) | Gruppen ] ] ' ' ( 1955-57 ) ; [ [ Donald Erb ] ] 's ' ' String Trio ' ' ( 1966 ) , [ [ Morton Feldman ] ] 's ' ' The Possibility of a New Work for Electric Guitar ' ' ( 1966 ) ; [ [ George Crumb ] ] 's ' ' Songs , Drones , and Refrains of Death ' ' ( 1968 ) ; [ [ Hans Werner Henze ] ] 's ' ' Versuch √ºber Schweine ' ' ( 1968 ) ; [ [ Francis Thorne ] ] 's ' ' Sonar Plexus ' ' ( 1968 ) and ' ' Liebesrock ' ' ( 1968‚Ä " 69 ) , [ [ Michael Tippett ] ] 's ' ' [ [ The Knot Garden ] ] ' ' ( 1965-70 ) ; [ [ Leonard Bernstein ] ] 's ' ' [ [ Mass ( Bernstein ) | MASS ] ] ' ' < ! -- Note : the composer titled this work in ALL CAPS -- > ( 1971 ) and ' ' Slava ! ' ' ( 1977 ) ; [ [ Louis Andriessen ] ] 's ' ' De Staat ' ' ( 1972-76 ) ; [ [ Steve Reich ] ] 's ' ' [ [ Electric Counterpoint ] ] ' ' ( 1987 ) , [ [ Arvo P√§rt ] ] 's ' ' Miserere ' ' ( 1989 / 92 ) , and countless works composed for the quintet of [ [ √-stor Piazzolla ] ] . In the 1980s and 1990s , a growing number of composers ( many of them composer-performers who had grown up playing the instrument in rock bands ) began writing contemporary classical music for the electric guitar . These include [ [ Shawn Lane ] ] , [ [ Steven Mackey ] ] , [ [ Nick Didkovsky ] ] , [ [ Scott Johnson ( composer ) | Scott Johnson ] ] , [ [ Lois V Vierk ] ] , [ [ Tim Brady ( composer ) | Tim Brady ] ] , [ [ Tristan Murail ] ] , [ [ John Rogers ] ] , and Randall Woolf . [ [ Yngwie Malmsteen ] ] released his [ [ Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra ] ] in 1998 , and [ [ Steve Vai ] ] released a double-live CD entitled ' ' [ [ Sound Theories ] ] ' ' , of his work with the Netherlands Metropole Orchestra in June 2007. < ref > [ http : / / vai . com / News / index . html [ vai . com - the official steve vai website & #93 ; < ! -- Bot generated title -- > ] < / ref > The American composers [ [ Rhys Chatham ] ] and [ [ Glenn Branca ] ] have written " symphonic " works for large ensembles of electric guitars , in some cases numbering up to 100 players , and the instrument is a core member of the [ [ Bang on a Can ] ] All-Stars ( played by [ [ Mark Stewart ( guitarist ) | Mark Stewart ] ] ) . Still , like many electric and electronic instruments , the electric guitar remains primarily associated with rock and jazz music , rather than with classical compositions and performances . < ref > For more on this subject see Robert Tomaro's " Contemporary Compositional Techniques for the Electric Guitar in United States Concert Music , " published in ' ' The Journal for New Music Research ' ' , v. 23 , no . 4 ( December 1994 ) , pp. 349-367 . < / ref > [ [ Guitar Prasanna | R.

In the 21st century , European avantgarde composers like [ [ Richard Barrett ] ] , [ [ Fausto Romitelli ] ] and [ [ Karlheinz Essl ] ] used the electric guitar ( together with extended playing techniques ) in solo pieces or ensemble works . = = See also = = { { guitar } } * [ [ 3rd Bridge ] ] * [ [ Guitar harmonics ] ] * [ [ Guitar / synthesizer ] ] * [ [ Bass guitar ] ] * [ [ Guitar effects ] ] * [ [ Guitar amplifier ] ] * [ [ Distortion ( guitar ) ] ] * [ [ Effects pedal ] ] * [ [ Electric pipa ] ] * [ [ Red Special ] ] * [ [ Electronic tuner ] ] * [ [ Vintage guitar ] ] * [ [ Keytar ] ] = = References = = { { Reflist | 2 } } = = Further reading = = * Denyer , Ralph , ' ' The Guitar Handbook ' ' , ( ISBN 0-330-32750-X ) , < small > Pan Books ; 2Rev Ed edition ( 27 November 1992 ) < / small > * Smith , Monica M. , [ http : / / www . americanheritage.com / articles / magazine / it / 2004 / 1 / 2004_1_12 . shtml " The Electric Guitar : How we got from Andr√©s Segovia to Kurt Cobain " ] , [ [ Invention and Technology Magazine ] ] , Summer 2004 , Volume 20 , Issue 1 . = = External links = = { { Commons category | Electric guitars } } * [ http : / / invention . smithsonian.org / centerpieces / guitars / From Frying Pan to Flying V : The Rise of the Electric Guitar ] * [ http : / / entertainment . howstuffworks.com / electric-guitar . htm HowStuffWorks ] - Includes a thorough article about how electric guitars work * [ http : / / kingofkays . com King of Kays ] - Information , photos , and videos of vintage electric guitars from the U.S. and the rest of the world . * [ http : / / www . liutaiomottola.com / instruments / wing . htm Chicken Wing Solid Body Electric Guitar ] - downloadable plans for building a solid body electric guitar , on the [ http : / / www . liutaiomottola.com / Liutaio Mottola Lutherie Information Website ] . * [ http : / / www . borntorock.tv / " Born to Rock " guitar exhibit ] at [ [ Harrods ] ] , London , February 2007 , featuring the 1931 Rickenbacker " Frying Pan " .

D	= = Plot = = An eccentric aging physician , Dr. Heidegger , calls together his old friends and contemporaries to test his waters of the " fountain of youth . " As the doctor himself sits by to enjoy the show , each of his four aged friends eagerly quaffs more and more of the magic potion , each draught further carrying them backwards into their shared youth . Having grown young , smooth-skinned and agile again , the three men begin to fight for the favors of the fourth compatriot now restored to her former beauty . In the heat of the fracas , they begin to grow tired and within minutes the effect of the " waters " has worn off . The participants in the brief respite from old age are devastated by the transience of the experience . Despite Heidegger's warning that he has learned to appreciate the advantage of age by watching the four of them make themselves fools , they learned no such lesson and resolve to make a pilgrimage to Florida to seek the Fountain .

D	was made WHAT A RUBBISH WEBPAGE 
I	first commercial [ [ high speed train | high-speed ] ] [ [ magnetic levitation train | maglev ] ] line in the world . The system and trains were built to the [ [ Transrapid ] ] standard . Construction began in March 2001 , and public service commenced 
D	writing just goes 
I	1 January 2004 . During a test run on 12 November 2003 , a maglev vehicle achieved a Chinese record speed of { { convert | 501 | km / h | abbr = on } } . The train set 
I	tracks were manufactured using [ [ Germany | German ] ] technology . = = Background = = The line runs from [ [ Longyang Road ] ] station in Pudong , 
I	the [ [ Shanghai Metro Line 2 | Shanghai subway line 2 ] ] to [ [ Pudong International Airport ] ] . The journey takes 7 minutes 
I	20 seconds to complete the distance of 30&nbsp ; km . A train can reach { { convert | 350 | km / h | abbr = 
I	} } in 2 minutes , 
I	the maximum normal operation speed of { { convert | 431 | km / h | abbr = 
D	not so many pictures come 
I	} } reached thereafter . The line is operated by Shanghai Maglev Transportation Development Co. , Ltd. { { as 
D	think 
I	| 2008 | 5 } } , the line operates daily between 06 : 45‚Ä " 21 : 30 , a one-way ticket cost [ [ renminbi | ¬• ] ] 50 ( US$7 
D	children please 
I	27 < ! -- 2008 exchange rate -- > ) , or ¬•40 ( $5.81 < ! -- 2008 exchange rate -- > ) for those passengers holding a receipt or proof of an airline ticket purchase . A round-trip return ticket cost ¬•80 ( $11.63 < ! -- 2008 exchange rate -- > ) 
D	Thats why I deleted everything 
I	[ [ VIP ] ] tickets cost double the standard fare . The service operates once every 15 or 20 minutes depending on the day and time . It can be easier and faster for those passengers with destinations in west ( [ [ Puxi ] ] ) Shanghai to use a [ [ taxicab | taxi ] ] directly from Pudong International Airport‚Ä " although missing out the " thrill factor " of riding on the high-speed Maglev . When discussing the practicality of other means of transport to the airport it is important to remember the name of the line ‰∏äÊµ∑Á£-ÊµÆÁ§∫Ëå-Ëø-Ë-•Á∫ø , partially translated as ' ' Demonstration Operation Line ' ' . Hans-Dieter Bott , vice president of Siemens when they won the contract to build the rail link stated that ' ' " Transrapid views the Shanghai line , where the ride will last just eight minutes , largely as a sales tool . This serves as a demonstration for China to show that 
D	put 
I	works and can be used for longer distances , such as Shanghai to Beijing " ' ' . < ref > { { cite web | url = http : / / www . independent.co.uk / news / world / asia / germans-win-bid-to-build-chinas-futuristic-rail-link-703123 . html | title = Germans win bid to build China's futuristic rail link } } < / ref > However , the decision was eventually made to implement the [ [ Beijing-Shanghai Express Railway ] ] with conventional high-speed technology . Of all the world's [ [ Airport rail link ] ] s , the ' ' Demonstration Operation Line ' ' is by far the fastest . In comparison the [ [ Heathrow Express ] ] link is a nonstop 26 . 5&nbsp ; km from central London to Heathrow airport . This distance is similar to the Shanghai link , but the Heathrow Express takes 15 minutes ( average speed 66 mph and top speed 100 mph ) . The Shanghai train is more than twice as fast , but it takes a full 4 minutes to reach its top speed of 431 km / h , and then must immediately begin slowing 
D	I couldnt put anything 
I	for 
D	about 
I	final 3 minutes and 20 seconds . Because the Shanghai 
I	was built before the connection to the local mass transit subway , it is often described as of little benefit to many people trying to get to the airport . < ref > { { cite news | author = Wu Zhong | title = China's dented image projects | url = http : / / www . atimes.com / atimes / China_Business / IF13Cb02 . html | publisher = [ [ Asia Times ] ] | date = 2007-06-13 } } < / ref > In 13 June , 2007 , ' ' Asia Times ' ' reported that it " could hardly be called a commercial success " , in part because " it virtually goes nowhere " . < ref > { { cite news | author = Wu Zhong | title = China's dented image projects | url = http : / / www . atimes.com / atimes / China_Business / IF13Cb02 . html | publisher = [ [ Asia Times ] ] | date = 2007-06-13 } } < / ref > = = = Operation = = = [ [ Image : Shanghai Maglev Driver . jpg | thumb | right | Shanghai Maglev Driver in the operating room ] ] [ [ Image : Shanghai Maglev VIP seat . jpg | thumb | right | Shanghai Maglev VIP cabin interior ] ] Following the opening , overall maglev

It is reported that as many as 10,000 students pass through Johnston Green throughout the day , with many staying to play games , or just sit on chairs and wait until the big moment . 420 is an event that every " pothead " knows , as it is a day that brings all marijuana smokers together to protest . This event is unofficial to the University , but is the most known and anticipated day for many students of Guelph . Proof of this event can be seen [ http : / / www . torontohemp.com / news / news380 . htm here ] on THC's website . It ends off the school year as exams usually end the within the same week . This event is usually spread through word of mouth , but since [ [ Facebook ] ] has become more popular , groups have been made to better organize the event . Even though the University does not sponser the event in any way , the Univeristy of Guelph website , Webadvisor displays the Johnston clock tower at the time ' 4 : 20 ' throughout the entire day .

He preferred to invent rather than use a formula . Now , he is not too fond of his earliest songs , and thinks they " sucked " . His songwriting style is mostly simple and basic , and he acknowledges that , saying he " [ never ] advanced past rudimentary " . He feels the way to write an honest song is to be simple , and that trying to complicate matters distorts the intended message . He believes the band has always tried to keep things as " simple and pure " as possible and has written from the heart .

I	Transcendentalism was rooted in the [ [ Transcendence ( philosophy ) | transcendental ] ] philosophy of [ [ Immanuel Kant ] ] ( and of [ [ German Idealism ] ] more generally ) , which the New England intellectuals of the early 19th century embraced as an alternative to the [ [ John Locke | Lockean ] ] " [ [ sensualism ] ] " of their fathers and of the [ [ Unitarianism | Unitarian church ] ] , finding the alternative in [ [ Veda | Vedic ] ] thought , [ [ German idealism ] ] , and English [ [ Romanticism ] ] . The transcendentalists desired to ground their religion and philosophy in transcendental principles : principles not based on , or falsifiable by , sensuous experience , but deriving from the inner , spiritual or mental essence of the human . Immanuel Kant had called " all knowledge transcendental which is concerned not with objects but with our mode of knowing objects . " The transcendentalists were largely unacquainted with [ [ German philosophy ] ] in the original , and relied primarily on the writings of [ [ Thomas Carlyle ] ] , [ [ Samuel Taylor Coleridge ] ] , [ [ Victor Cousin ] ] , [ [ Germaine de Sta√´l ] ] , and other English and French commentators for their knowledge of it . In contrast , they were intimately familiar with the English [ [ Romanticism | Romantics ] ] , and the transcendental movement may be partially described as a slightly later , American outgrowth of Romanticism . Another major influence was the mystical spiritualism of [ [ Emanuel Swedenborg ] ] . Thoreau in ' ' Walden ' ' spoke of the debt to the Vedic thought directly , as did other members of the movement : { { Quotation | In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the [ [ Bhagavat Geeta ] ] , since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed , and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial ; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence , so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions . I lay down the book and go to my well for water , and lo ! there I meet the servant of the [ [ Brahmin ] ] , priest of [ [ Brahma ] ] , and [ [ Vishnu ] ] and [ [ Indra ] ] , who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas , or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water-jug . I meet his servant come to draw water for his master , and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well . The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges . } }

D	There are rumors that A " Super Volcano " is Threatening Yellowstone National Park in The United States . Changes in Yellowstone National Park may be signs of the overdue eruption of a " super volcano " underneath the park . This is one of those stories that is based on some actual events happening at Yellowstone National Park . The exact truth of it , however , is difficult to determine , primarily because it's impossible to predict when volcanic and geologic events are going to take place . The experts at the National Park Service and the U.S. Geologic Survey , however , feel that the Rumor is exaggerated and may cause undue alarm . But other reports say there are signs of this " Super Eruption " may be a reality . Experts say that the grounds where Yellowstone National Park is located rises about a foot a year . With the ground bulging a foot a year the possibility of this " Super Eruption " may be a reality .

I	Later the band travelled for another tour to United States but this time they went without Rohail Hyatt as Rohail refused to go and Junaid agreed upon going with Aamir as he suggested to him . Soon after , Rohail announced his departure from the band . On returning , Juniad reproached Rohail and along-with Shahzad coaxed Rohail to rejoin . The meeting did not have Zaki , and when the Signs were interviewed in a TV show in mid-‚Ä ô 94 , here too Zaki was missing from the line-up . But Aamir Zaki was still there with the band when they finally started work on the new album . The process was broken when the Signs flew to [ [ Dubai ] ] for a couple of concerts .

D	= = = Differences between the original book and the film = = = Differences between the original book include ( though are not limited to ) : * The program administrator's name and personality are different‚Ä " the subplot of Kitano's family and his love for Noriko is not present in [ [ Kinpatsu Sakamochi ] ] ‚Ä " the equivalent character‚Ä " in the novel . Additionally , Sakamochi had no previous relationship with the class , and is significantly more sadistic than Kitano . * [ [ Kazuo Kiriyama ] ] is a transfer student in the film ( playing voluntarily ) , whereas in the novel he was a member of the class . In the film he is silent , and it is suggested he signed up for fun , whereas in the novel and manga he flips a coin to determine his course of action . In the novel / manga he is incapable of feeling emotion , which is unlikely to be true in the film if he did sign up for fun . Neither of these is confirmed or denied in the film however . * Mitsuko's killing of [ [ Hirono Shimizu ] ] in the film‚Ä " as opposed to [ [ Toshinori Oda ] ] killing Hirono in the novel‚Ä " replaces a scene in the book in which Hiroki confronts Mitsuko over Chigusa's death shortly before he locates Kotohiki , though she escapes him . * In the film , Kazuo does not kill [ [ Mizuho Inada ] ] , and Hirono does not kill Kaori Minami . Instead , Mizuho and Kaori form a team and kill each other over a [ [ life preserver ] ] . * The film depicts the students as residents of the [ [ Kanagawa Prefecture ] ] , as Mimura's postcard reveals a mailing address in the name of " Mr. Sinji Mimura " in Kanagawa Prefecture . With the exception of Shogo Kawada , most students in the film speak [ [ Japanese_dialects#Kant≈ç Dialect | Kant≈ç ben ] ] , the dialect of the Eastern [ [ Kant≈ç region ] ] , which includes Kanagawa . The novel and manga set Shiroiwa in the rural [ [ Kagawa Prefecture ] ] , on [ [ Shikoku ] ] island . * Various students start with different weapons and die in different manners . Almost every student is given a background in the novel , whereas only the significant characters receive them in the film . * The ' victory ' deadline is changed from the book ; in the film , the students are given three days to win , while in the book , the only deadline is that at least one student be killed every twenty-four hours . Further , only one class participates per year in the film , whereas it is fifty in the novel . * In the film , the " police state " overtones are toned down ( but are still noticeably present ) , while the idea of a major social and economic upheaval being the cause of the story's events is introduced in the introduction . * The school uniforms featured in the film are different than the ones featured in the novel . * In the book Kazuo is killed by Noriko and Shogo after a large shootout and car chase ( the latter being fully absent in the film ) , while in the film Shogo Kawada kills Kiriyama . * The Battle Royale logo is never described in the book . * There is no " introductory video " in the novel . The rules of the Battle Royale are simply read out in the classroom by Sakamochi . * Shogo mentions he was not with [ [ Keiko Onuki ] ] during the previous game in the book , also he makes no mention of killing a friend so they could both survive . * Noriko is shot in the leg in the book , but is shot in the arm in the movie . * The film portrays Mitsuko's coldness as having stemmed from a childhood during which she inadvertently kills a man to avoid being raped after she is pimped by her mother for money . In the novel , Mitsuko is unable to escape several incidents of rape in which she is a brain-washed and love-starved participant . * In the film , the Battle Royale Act is introduced to deal with widespread youth delinquency . In the novel , reason for the Act is slightly different in that it exists to keep the totalitarian government in control , by inspiring people to fear and distrust each other . * In the novel the character Hiroki Sugimura is adept at martial arts and utilises this skill in several scenes ; no mention is made of it in the movie . * In the film , Shogo initially runs off after saving Shuya from Kyoichi and they meet up later when Noriko is ill. In the novel , they stay together after this encounter and travel as a trio to a medical clinic when Noriko is ill. * In the film , Shogo immediately returns after leaving saying that he was given the wrong day pack and receives a new one . His exit is not mentioned at all in the novel . * In the novel , Kazuo Kiriyama is the leader of a gang consisting of Mitsuri Numai , Sho Tsukioka , Ryuhei Sasagawa , and Hiroshi Kuronaga . They are known in the original novel as " the Kiriyama family . " * Similar to the Kiriyama family in the novel , Mitsuko Souma was the leader of a group that consisted of Yoshimi Yahagi and Hirono Shimizu . * Mitsuko is somewhat of a loner in the film . She thinks of herself as a loser . In the novel , she has friends and is very popular .

The RISD graphic design graduate program is considered one of the leading graduate design programs worldwide . ‚ÄúTom is known for bringing to light methods for perceiving the mechanisms of meaning in visual communication design . This interest was first stimulated by his experiments in concrete poetry with what he called ‚Äúword and image equations . ‚Äù Then he was drawn into semiotics as an intellectual theory that deals with questions concerning meaning , cognition , reference , truth , and reality , which he developed into a tool based on the principles developed by logician C.

I	From TheWorld's Hope , August 1 , 1897 , pages 234-235 Brother Conley At Rest Dear Bro . Paton : Our very dear friend and brother , Wm H. Conley of Allegheny , passed behind the vail at about 8 : 30 this evening . ( July 25 ) . " his end was peace , " as became a good soldier of Jesus anointed . You know much of his faithfulness , but we think no one but the Heavenly Father in whose love he lived , and loved and walked , knew how true , and kind , and good a friend he was . He has not been well for a long time , and had been running down for several months . He had an attack of La Grippe four or five months ago , from which he never fully rallied . He has been but twice out of the house in six weeks , ‚Ä " to the house of prayer on both occasions . About noon today , a few of his dearest Christian brothers and sisters had a season of prayer with him , and afterward sung some sweet trustful verses and choruses that he liked . For the first time in weeks his sweet bass voice went out in unison with ours , and he joined in the prayer and praise . You know what a splendid voice he had . I was certainly surprised today‚Ä " knowing of his shortness of breath , etc. ‚Ä " to hear it once more . It was his last notes of praise in the flesh to the One he loved so well . Toward evening he sank rapidly . His wife , his dear old mother , some other relatives , and Christian friends stood around his bed as he passed over . There was a heavenly atmosphere . One sister said it seemed to her as if angels filled the room . And while there were many tears , -- for human love and sympathy must manifest itself , -- yet there were hallelujahs in loving hearts for the victory that only the faithful win . He will be greatly missed . His clear cut testimonies as to the faithfulness of God , the integrity of His word , the doming of our Lord , and the restitution of the ages to come , will ong be remembered by many . " Christ in me the hope of glory , " was one of his favorite hymns , and typical of the songs he loved to sing . He expected to be a member of the cabinet ( as he so often expressed it ) of the King of Kings , in the rule of the nations in power and blessing . " This honor have all His saints , " Ps. cxlix . He gave liberally , counting himself only a steward of the wealth the Father placed in his hands . He counted himself a part of that Seed who is to bless all the families of the earth , and he began to practice down here with that which was put in his hand . We believe fully that in this feature his work has only begun , and that he will share in the glory and exercise of that which he so dearly loved to do . He rests in the blessed hope . Remember dear Sister Conley in this hour of bereavement and trial . In Christian love , W. I. Mann , Pittsburg , PA . From The World's Hope , August 1 , 1897 , pages 235 On reaching home today ( July 28. ) ‚Ä " the day appointed for Bro . Conley's funeral‚Ä " this word from Bro . Mann was handed me , and the sudden feeling of sadness that filled my heart cannot be expressed . And at the very hour of the funeral service , when brothers and sisters are gathered to mingle their tears of grief and sympathy , I am at my desk writing these lines . Had it been possible , I should have been with the friends in the house of mourning . I loved Bro . Conley , and none who knew him will wonder at this . For over twenty years he has been my faithful friend . Many times during these years I have shared the generous hospitality of that Christian home . Often has the spacious parlor been opened for the purposes of praise and prayer , and for the proclamation of the good tidings . It has been to many a Bethel‚Ä " the house of God and the gate of heaven . We cannot but mourn . Tears unbidden starts . But they are not hopeless . Our blessed Lord said , ‚Ä-Blessed are they that mourn , for they shall be comforted . ' May the Holy spirit bring needed consolation to the hearts of Sister Conley , the aged mother , and the many who have learned to think of the departed one as beloved in the Lord . And while we wait a little longer , until we shall follow him through the vail , may we be encouraged to faithfulness by the memory of his devoted life .. " Editor ( J. H.

I	Plot 
D	Yoo ! : D 
I	Throughout the [ [ 21st century ] ] , Earth was governed by the Buy n Large [ [ megacorporation ] ] ( BnL ) , causing mass [ [ consumerism ] ] and covering the planet in trash by [ [ 2105 ] ] . In an attempt to resolve the situation , Earth's population was evacuated on fully automated luxury BnL [ [ space station | star ] ] [ [ ocean liner | liners ] ] for five years while an army of trash compactor robots called WALL-E's were left behind to clean 
D	Hey best frann : D What's 
I	the planet . The plan failed in 2110 , however , forcing humanity to remain in space indefinitely . Seven hundred years later , in 2805 , only one WALL-E unit functions , having survived by salvaging parts for himself from other defunct WALL-E units . This unit has developed [ [ sentience ] ] and a sense of [ [ emotion ] ] , particularly [ [ curiosity ] ] , as shown by his quirky habits of collecting knickknacks from the mountains of trash . One day , WALL-E finds a seedling plant growing among the trash and returns it to his ' home ' inside an old transport truck . Later , a spaceship lands and deploys an advanced [ [ space probe | probe ] ] robot named EVE . WALL-E immediately falls in love with EVE as she carries out her [ [ directive ( programming ) | directive ] ] of searching for signs of plant life . Initially aloof and hostile , EVE begins to warm up to WALL-E and takes a liking to him . During a [ [ dust storm ] ] , WALL-E takes EVE to his truck and shows her the plant , causing her automated systems to store the plant inside her , activate a homing beacon , and deactivate her . WALL-E goes to great lengths to try to revive and take care of her , even going on a date with the inactive robot . When her ship returns to collect her , WALL-E desperately clings to the hull of the ship as it returns to the ' ' Axiom ' ' , the flagship of the BnL fleet . Upon docking , WALL-E follows EVE as she is taken to the bridge of the ship . As he progresses through the ' ' Axiom ' ' it becomes apparent that after centuries of living in [ [ Weightlessness#Microgravity | microgravity ] ] and relying on the ship's automated systems , the human passengers have suffered [ [ Spaceflight osteopenia | severe bone loss ] ] and become extremely [ [ obesity | obese ] ] . The Captain himself does little , leaving control of the ship to the autopilot , Auto . When EVE is brought to the bridge , the Captain learns that by placing her plant sample inside the ship's holo-detector as a sign of Earth being habitable again , the ' ' Axiom ' ' will enter [ [ hyperspace ( science fiction ) | hyperspace ] ] and return to Earth to allow its passengers to repopulate the planet . However , when they open EVE , the plant is missing . EVE is considered defective and taken to the robot repair ward along with WALL-E , though the Captain's curiosity is piqued and he begins researching Earth history . At the repair ward , WALL-E causes chaos and accidentally releases a horde of malfunctioning robots to roam the ship , resulting in the ship's security designating him and EVE as " rogue robots . " Annoyed with WALL-E's disruptive influence , EVE attempts to send him back to Earth on an [ [ escape pod ] ] . However , they see Auto's assistant GO-4 deposit the missing plant into the escape pod and set it to self-destruct . WALL-E manages to save the plant , and EVE gives him a " kiss " in the form of an electric spark . The two robots celebrate on a [ [ spacewalk ] ] around the ' ' Axiom ' ' before returning the plant to the Captain . The Captain reviews EVE's visual records of the devastated Earth , and vows to return there to restore the planet . EVE , meanwhile , sees WALL-E's commitment to her well-being while she was inactive and falls in love with him . However , Auto stages a [ [ mutiny ] ] , revealing that he was given a final [ [ directive ( programming ) | directive ] ] to prevent ' ' Axiom ' ' { { ' } } s return to Earth centuries ago when the cleanup project was considered a failure . Auto locks the Captain in his quarters and electrocutes WALL-E , sending him down a trash chute with EVE and the plant . With WALL-E severely damaged , EVE realizes the only parts to repair him with are on Earth , which they can reach quickly if they can activate the hyperjump . With the help of the other rogue robots and the human passengers , WALL-E and EVE attempt to place the plant in the holo-detector , but Auto's control of the ship prevents them from doing so , and WALL-E is further damaged in the process . The Captain breaks free of his quarters and deactivates Auto , allowing the holo-detector to activate , sending the ship back to Earth . EVE quickly takes WALL-E back to his truck and attempts to repair him from his spare parts , but WALL-E's memory and personality appear to have been erased as he reverts to his original trash-compacting duties . Heartbroken , EVE gives him a farewell " kiss " , which causes another spark that inadvertently restores WALL-E to his unique personality , happily reuniting the two robots . WALL-E and EVE rejoin the humans and robots as they begin working together to restore Earth , taking care to plant the seedling that brought them back home . During the ending credits , a montage is shown of the humans and robots working together . Gradually over time , the trash is cleaned up and the cities are rebuilt . Humans and robots live side-by-side to create a paradise on the planet . The final scene is of WALL-E and EVE , holding hands , looking up at a huge tree . As the scene scrolls up , it is revealed that the tree was the small seedling that WALL-E originally found .

D	= = Soul food and health = = Soul food was developed by enslaved African-Americans who lived under the difficult and impoverished conditions of grinding physical labor . It is humble , hearty fare , traditionally cooked and seasoned with [ [ pork ] ] products and often fried in [ [ lard ] ] . Formerly , an important aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard . Because many cooks were too poor to throw out shortening that had already been used , they would pour the cooled liquid grease into a container . After cooling completely , the grease resolidified and could be used again the next time the cook required lard . Frequent consumption of these ingredients without significant exercise or activity may contribute to disproportionately high occurrences of [ [ obesity ] ] , [ [ hypertension ] ] , cardiac / circulatory problems , and / or [ [ type 2 diabetes ] ] , conditions which often result in shortened lifespan . Additionally , trans fat , which is used not only in soul food , but in many baked goods , is a known contributor to [ [ cardiovascular disease ] ] . { { Citation needed | date = November 2009 } } As a result , some African-Americans may use methods of cooking soul food different from those employed by their grandparents , including using more healthful alternatives for frying ( liquid [ [ vegetable oil ] ] or [ [ canola oil ] ] ) and cooking and stewing using smoked [ [ domesticated turkey | turkey ] ] instead of pork . Changes in hog farming techniques have also resulted in drastically leaner pork . Some cooks have even adapted recipes to include healthier alternatives to traditional ingredients including tofu and soy-based analogues . < ref > { { cite web | last = Shelf | first = Angela | url = http : / / www . enotalone.com / article / 4825 . html | title = African Vegetarian Recipes : The Ethnic Vegetarian | publisher = Enotalone . com | date = | accessdate = 2009-06-20 } } < / ref > Critics have argued that the attempt to make soul food healthier has the undesirable effect of not being as flavorful as the traditional recipes . < ref > { { cite web | last = Jonsson | first = Patrick | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Backstory : Southern discomfort food | work = [ [ The Christian Science Monitor ] ] | publisher = [ [ The First Church of Christ , Scientist | The Christian Science Publishing Society ] ] | date = February 6 , 2006 | url = http : / / www . csmonitor.com / 2006 / 0206 / p20s01-lifo . html | accessdate = 2006-11-09 } } < / ref > Certain staples of a soul food diet have pronounced health benefits .
